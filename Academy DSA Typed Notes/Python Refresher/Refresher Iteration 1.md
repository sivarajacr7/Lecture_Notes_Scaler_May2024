## Introduction
* Imagine we wish to print the numbers from `1` to `1000`. 
* So we can write the code as follows:
```python
print(1)
print(2)
..
..
..
print(1000)
```
* This is not an intelligent task to do. If the task is simple and we want to repeat it 5 times, we might write the same piece of code 5 times But this is not a practical approach if the repetition number is like `100` or `1000`.
* There is a principle in programming called **DRY**


Do you know the full form of it?
* **Don't Repeat Yourself**
* Even if you are writing the same code three times, you are not doing a good job at it. We can either use loops or functions.
* Before seeing loops, let us see why Python does things in a certain way.
* I have a friend Ramesh and I have to take `10` toffies from him. I will pick a chocolate and start counting from `1` until I reach `10` and then stop.
* Let us see in code what we are doing. Each time in a loop we will check if condition until we reach the else part.

```python
count = 0
if(count < 10):
    take toffee
    count += 1
else
    stop
```


* There are four things we always do in a loop:
    1. Initialization
    2. Condition
    3. Action
    4. Updation
* We will discuss the `while` loop in this class and the `for` loop in the next as it is different in different programming languages.
* The while loop will only run till the condition is true. As soon as the condition becomes false we exit the loop and execute the rest of the code.



### Syntax

```python
variable initialization
while (condition)
{
    action
    update variable
}
```
![image](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/066/356/original/upload_5df881452fccdde7c6aeb1db1b70e8a0.png?1708931114)

This can be read as while this condition is **true** perform this action and update the variable.
 
Let us quickly move to an example to understand better.

## Print numbers from 1 to n


### Example 1 - Print Numbers from 1 to n
```python
    n = input()
    count = 1
    while(count <= n): # can also be written as (count < n + 1)
        print(count)
        count += 1
    print("end")
```
* Parenthesis are optional in while condition. 
* Dry run for n = 5

If I do not write the incrementing `count` statement what will happen?

It will fall in the infinite loop and `1` will be printed forever.

* Always ensure you have all 4 things while writing a loop. 
* In any programming language all the loops will always have these four things.
* An alternative way of writing this code is as follows:
```python
n = input()
count = 0
while count < n:
    count += 1
    print(count)
```
This is because counting in programming languages starts from `0`. Array indexing in most of the languages also starts from `0`. This is doing the same thing except the statements are shuffled.

## Print number from n to 1


### Example 2 - Print Number From n to 1
* Go grab your notebook, iPad, or laptop try writing code for the above question, and put the solution in the chat section.
* Writing in a book is best practice.

```python
n = int(input())
while n >= 1:
    print(n)
    n -= 1
```

* Dry run for n = 5

## Print even numbers from 1 to 100


### Example 3 - Print Even Numbers From 1 to 100
* Once done paste it into the chat section
**Note:** Don't forget the updation of a variable. Also, some of the solutions have conditions where the loop doesn't run at all.
```python
n = int(input())
count = 1
while count <= n:
    if count % 2 == 0:
        print(count)
    count += 1
```
* Write the updation statement in the beginning only.

**Alternative Solution:**
In each interaction, we can update the count by 2. Initially, instead of starting from 1, we can start from 2, and in each iteration, we can do `count += 2` this will always result in an even number.

```python
n = int(input()):
count = 2
while count <= n:
    print(count)
    count += 2
```
![image](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/066/359/original/upload_1548f50a2f2023d5e00150ec29692b2f.png?1708931216)
This is an optimization of the above code as we are not checking the condition as well as the loop will only run half the times of `n`.

---
## Print the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20


### Example 4 - Print the Sum of All Even Numbers From 1 to 20
We already know how to generate even numbers between `1` to `20`. 

Instead of printing it, we need to store it in the bucket.

So we can keep adding these to a number and return the sum at the end.
```python
sum = 0
count = 2
while(count <= n):
    sum += count
    count += 2
print(sum)
```

## Print the digits of number `459`


### Example (VVIMP) - Print the Digits of Number 459 (order Doesn't Matter)
* How to get digits of a number in iteration
* Scraper -> extracts the last digit
* Scissors -> Cuts the last digit
![image](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/066/360/original/upload_37782f2922540e6578503eb663cec769.png?1708931339)

We will scrape the last digit, print the result, and cut the last digit. This process is continued until all the digits are cut. This is a loop, right?


Is there any operation I told you in the past which takes `459` and returns `9`?
 * taking `% 10` (modulo 10) will return the last digit.
 * `459 % 10 -> 9`
 * `45 % 10 -> 5`
 * `4 % 10 -> 4`

Is there any operation that takes `459` and returns `45`, basically cutting the last digit?
 * taking `/ 10` (integer division by 10) will return the last digit.
 * `int(459 / 10) -> 45`
 * `int(45 / 10) -> 4`
 * `int(4 / 10) -> 0`

Only division will give the floor value such as `45.9`. Also, `459 // 10` doesn't work with negative integers as `-459` will give `-45.9 -> -46`. Thus, we can simply use `int(val)` to get the integer part of the remaining number.
```python
n = int(input())
while n > 0:
    print(n % 10)
    n = int(n / 10)
```

## Break and Continue Statements

### Break Statement
**Note:** Only for loops
If you want to break out of the loop if a certain condition is met then you use `break`. It will break the entire loop and execute the next statement.

**Definition** Whenever a break is executed inside a loop, it terminates the loop.

What will be the output of the following code?
```python
count = 1
while count <= 100:
    if count == 4:
        break
    print(count, end=" ")
    count += 1
```
**Output**
```plaintext
1 2 3
```



### Continue Statement
**Note:** Only for loops
**Definition** It skips the inside loop and continues the loop's execution.

```python
count = 1
while count <= 10:
    count += 1
    if count == 4:
        continue
    print(count, end=" ")

```

**Output**

```plaintext
1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
```
* The continue statement simply skips the rest of the instructions of the current interaction and begins with the next iteration.

Look at the example below:
```python
count = 1
while count <= 10:
    if count == 4:
        continue
    print(count, end=" ")
    count += 1

```
* This will end up in an infinite loop. As the updation condition is never performed due to continue statment. So once it reaches 4, it keeps looping on 4.



---
## While-else
* Only and only in Python
* Else block will run only after the loop successfully terminates without a break.
```python
count = 1
while count <= 100:
    if count == 4:
        break
    print(count, end=" ")
    count += 1
else:
    print("Yayy!")

```
* It will not print `Yayy!` as it is terminated via a `break` statement rather than terminating naturally.

## Check whether a number is prime or not

### Example - Check Whether a Number is Prime or Not
* Prime number is only divisible by `1` or the number itself.
* One is neither prime not consonant.
* We can say that `a` is divisible by `n` if `a % n == 0`.
* We can say that `24` is not prime as `24` divides `2, 4, 6, 8, etc.`
* We can say that `23` is a prime number cause it only divides `1` and `23`.
* Write a code to check if the number is prime or not. Start a loop from `2` to `n-1` if it is dividing any number then return `not prime` else `prime`. We are not required to use `break`, `continue`, or `while else`.

**Solution 1:**

Let us say our number is `25`.
We will use a variable `flag` to store whether a number is prime or not. It is simply a boolean variable initialized with `false`. 

As soon as the number is divisible by some other number we can change its value to `true` and it is not prime. If the number is not divisible by any other number the `flag` remains `false` and we can conclude that it is a prime number.

```python
n = int(input())
count = 2
flag = False
while count < n:
    if n % count == 0:
        flag = True
    count += 1
if flag:
    print("Not Prime")
else:
    print("Prime")

```

**Solution 2:**

* Is not very different from the previous solution.
* Now consider if the number is `9`, it is divisible by `3`. Do we need to check for other numbers? We don't! If the given number is divisible by any other number, we can break from the loop and declare that it is prime.
* This is a great situation where we can use `break`.

```python
n = int(input())
count = 2
flag = False
while count < n:
    if n % count == 0:
        flag = True
        break
    count += 1
if flag:
    print("Not Prime")
else:
    print("Prime")

```

**Solution 2:**

* We can remove the flag. We can use the `while else` statement. 
* Instead of checking the flag, we can say that if we didn't break from the loop, it is a prime number.
* So as soon as we encounter that the number is divisible by some other number we print it is not prime. In the else part we print it is prime.

```python
n = int(input())
i = 2
while i < n:
    if n % i == 0:
        print("not prime")
        break
    i += 1
else:
    print("prime number")

```
