## Merge Intervals

An Interval is defined by start and end time, where start <= end.

Say we are given a list of Intervals, we will have to merge them if they overlap.

Let's look at them below -

### Non-Overlapping Condition

Say there are two Intervals, I1 {s1 e1} & I2 {s2 e2}
Then the condition for them to not overlap is -


<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/052/055/original/Screenshot_2023-09-27_at_1.25.30_PM.png?1696314640)" width=500 />

```javascript
if(s2 > e1 || s1 > e2)
```

So, if above condition is not followed, it says that Intervals are overlapping!


### How to merge overlapping Intervals ?


**[I1.start , I1.end] & [I2.start , I2.end]**
After merging -
**[min(I1.start, I2.start) , max(I1.end, I2.end)]**

### Question
If the intervals [3, 8] and [5, 12] are given, do they overlap?

**Choices**
- [x] Yes
- [ ] No


### Explanation:

Answer: Yes

The intervals [3, 8] and [5, 12] overlap because 8 is greater than 5. The overlapping area is [5, 8]

---
### Question
What is the correct way to represent the merged result of intervals [6, 10] and [8, 15]?

**Choices**
- [x] [6, 15]
- [ ] [6, 8, 10, 15]
- [ ] [6, 10] and [8, 15]
- [ ] [8, 10]

### Explanation:

[6, 15]

This is because the merging of intervals involves combining overlapping intervals into a single, continuous interval


---
### Problem 1 : Merge sorted Overlapping Intervals

**Problem Statement**
Given a sorted list of overlapping intervals, sorted based on start time, merge all overlapping intervals and return sorted list.

**Input:**
Interval[] = {(0,2), (1,4), (5,6), (6,8), (7,10), (8,9), (12,14)}

**Output:**

{(0,4), (5,10), (12,14)}

#### Explanation:


| Interval 1 | Interval 2 |                 | Answer Interval List |
|:----------:|:----------:|:---------------:|:--------------------:|
|    0-2     |    1-4     |   Overlapping   |         0-4          |
|    0-4     |    5-6     | Not Overlapping |       0-4, 5-6       |
|    5-6     |    6-8     |   Overlapping   |       0-4, 5-8       |
|    5-8     |    7-10    |   Overlapping   |      0-4, 5-10       |
|    5-10    |    8-9     |   Overlapping   |      0-4, 5-10       |
|    5-10    |   12-14    | Not Overlapping |   0-4, 5-10, 12-14   |


#### The Array Is Sorted Based on Start Time. What Is the Overlapping Condition? 
Say start time of A < start time of B

<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/052/056/original/Screenshot_2023-09-27_at_1.55.29_PM.png?1696314693)" width=300 />

Overlapping Condition - 
**If start of B <= end of A**

### Question
Given a sorted list of overlapping intervals, sorted based on start time, merge all overlapping intervals and return sorted list.

**Input:**
Interval[] = { (1,10), (2, 3), (4, 5), (9, 12)}

**Choices**
- [x] (1, 12)
- [ ] (1, 10), (9, 12)
- [ ] (1, 9), (9, 12)
- [ ] No Change 


#### Problem 1 Approach

* Create an array to store the merged intervals.
* If the current and ith intervals overlaps, merge them. In this case update the current interval with the merged interval.
* Else, insert the current interval to answer array since it doesn't overlap with any other interval and update the current Interval to ith Interval.

#### Dry Run

**Input:**
Interval[] = {(0,2), (1,4), (5,6), (6,8), (7,10), (8,9), (12,14)}

#### Explanation:


| current |  ith  |                 | After merging | answer list |
|:-------:|:-----:|:---------------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|
|   0-2   |  1-4  |   Overlapping   |      0-4      |             |
|   0-4   |  5-6  | Not Overlapping |  Not needed   |     0-4     |
|   5-6   |  6-8  |   Overlapping   |      5-8      |     0-4     |
|   5-8   | 7-10  |   Overlapping   |     5-10      |     0-4     |
|  5-10   |  8-9  |   Overlapping   |     5-10      |     0-4     |
|  5-10   | 12-14 | Not Overlapping |  Not needed   |  0-4, 5-10  |
|  12-14  |  end  |                 |               |             |

At the end, we are left with the last interval, so add it to the list.

#### Pseudocode
```cpp
//Already a class/structure will be present for Interval
//We will only need to create an answer array of type Interval

list < Interval > ans;

// Current Segment
int cur_start = A[0].start, cur_end = A[0].end;

for (int i = 1; i < A.size(); i++) {

  // if i'th interval overlaps with current interval
  if (A[i].start <= cur_end) {
    // merging them
    cur_end = max(cur_end, A[i].end);
  } else {
    //adding current interval to answer.
    //create a new Interval
    Interval temp(cur_start, cur_end); //if struct is declared, otherwise if class is declared then we can simply use new keyword
    ans.push_back(temp);

    // update cur Interval to ith
    cur_start = A[i].start;
    cur_end = A[i].end;
  }
}
Interval temp(cur_start, cur_end);
ans.push_back(temp);
return ans;
```

#### Complexity
**Time Complexity:** O(N)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Problem 2 Sorted Set of Non Overlapping Intervals

Given a sorted list of overlapping intervals based on start time, insert a new interval such that the final list of intervals is also sorted and non-overlapping.
Print the Intervals.

**Example 1:**
**N = 9**
(1,3)
(4,7)
(10,14)
(16,19)
(21,24)
(27,30)
(32,35)
(38,41)
(43,50)

New Interval
**(12, 22)**

**Explanation:**

|   ith   |   new Interval   |   Overlaps?   | Print |
|-------|----------|----------|-----------------|
|   (1,3)   |    (12,22)     |   No      |     (1,3)         |
|   (4,7)  |    (12,22)     |    No     |     (4,7)         |
|   (10,14)   |    (12,22)     |    Yes; merged: (10,22)     ||
|   (16,19)   |    (10,22)     |    Yes; merged: (10,22)     ||
|   (21,24)   |    (10,22)     |    Yes; merged: (10,24)     ||
|   (27,30)   |    (10,22)     |    No; small new Interval gets printed first     |(10,22)|
| (32,35)| | |(32,35)|
| (38,41)| | |(38,41) |
| (43,50)| | | (43,50)|

**Please Note:** Once the new Interval gets printed, all the Intervals following it also gets printed.

**More Examples**

**Example 2:**
**N = 5**
(1,5)
(8,10)
(11,14)
(15,20)
(21,24)

New Interval
**(12, 24)**

|   ith   | new Interval |      Overlaps?       | Print  |
|:-------:|:------------:|:--------------------:|:------:|
|  (1,5)  |   (12, 24)   |          No          | (1,5)  |
| (8,10)  |   (12, 24)   |          No          | (8,10) |
| (11,14) |   (12, 24)   | Yes; merged:(11, 24) |        |
| (15,20) |   (11, 24)   | Yes; merged:(11, 24) |        |
| (21,24) |   (11, 24)   | Yes; merged:(11, 24) |        |

We are done with all the intervals but left the new Interval at the end; in this case we have to print the new Interval.

**Example 3:**

### Question
If the sorted set of non-overlapping intervals is [1, 5], [6, 10], and [12, 15], what happens if you add the interval `[4, 7]` such that the final list of intervals is also sorted and non-overlapping.?

**Choices**
- [x] [1, 10] and [12, 15]
- [ ] [1, 5], [4, 7], [6, 10], [12, 15]
- [ ] [1, 5] and [6, 10] only
- [ ] No change


#### Explanation:
(1,5)
(6,10)
(12,15)

New Interval
**(4, 7)**

|   ith   | new Interval |      Overlaps?       | Print  |
|:-------:|:------------:|:--------------------:|:------:|
|  (1,5)  |   (4, 7)   | Yes; merged:(1, 7)  |        |
| (6,10)  |   (1, 7)   | Yes; merged:(1, 10)  |    |
| (12,15) |   (1, 10)   |  No; small new Interval gets printed first  | (1, 10) |
| (12,15) |      |    | (12, 15) |

Thus after merging, the intervals are [1, 10] and [12, 15]

#### Problem 2 Pseudocode

```cpp

void merge(int Interval[], int nS, int nE) {
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        int L = Interval[i].start, R = Interval[i].end;

        //Not Overlapping
        if (nS > R) {
            print({
                L,
                R
            });
        }
        // new Interval is not overlapping and is smaller
        // print new Interval and then all the remaining Intervals
        else if (L > nE) {
            print({
                nS,
                nE
            });

            for (int j = i; j < N; j++) {
                print({
                    Interval[j].start,
                    Interval[j].end
                })
            }
            return;
        } else {
            nS = min(L, nS);
            nE = max(R, nE);
        }
    }
    print({
        nS,
        nE
    });
}
```

#### Complexity
**Time Complexity:** O(N)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Choices**
- [x] 4
- [ ] 6
- [ ] -3
- [ ] 8

Please take some time to think about the solution approach on your own before reading further.....

### Find First Missing Natural Number Solution Approach
#### Approach 1: Brute Force
Check for all the numbers from 1 till we get the answer
**T.C -** O(N * ans)

Here, in the worst case answer can go uptil N+1, in case if all numbers from 1 to N are present in the array.

**Example -** {4, 1, 3, 2}
Here we will have to iterate till 5, ie. N+1.

#### Idea
**Can we utilise the fact that answer can be out of 1 to N+1?**
If any number other than 1 to N is present, then missing is out of 1 to N only.
If all elements from 1 to N are present, then it will be N+1.

Say we start checking if 1 is present or not, we somehow want to mark the presence of 1.
Now, since we can't use extra space, so we can use indices to mark the presence of a number.

Index 0 can be used to mark presence of 1.
Index 1 can be used to mark presence of 2.
Index 2 can be used to mark presence of 3.
so on....

**Now how do we mark the presence ?**

**One Solution:**
```plaintext
We can set element at that index as negative. 
```

*But what if negative number is part of the input?*

**Let's assume only positive numbers are present**
We can use indices to mark the presence of a number.
We can set element at that index as negative.

**A[ ] = {8, 1, 4, 2, 6, 3}**

```plaintext
N = 6
Answer can be from [1 7]
So, if any number is beyond this range, we don't care!
```

| index | element |       presence marked at index        |   state of the array    |
|:-----:|:-------:|:-------------------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
|   0   |    8    | don't care, since out of answer range |                         |
|   1   |    1    |                   0                   |   {-8, 1, 4, 2, 6, 3}   |
|   2   |    4    |                   3                   |  {-8, 1, 4, -2, 6, 3}   |
|   3   |    2    |                   1                   |  {-8, -1, 4, -2, 6, 3}  |
|   4   |    6    |                   5                   | {-8, -1, 4, -2, 6, -3}  |
|   5   |    3    |                   2                   | {-8, -1, -4, -2, 6, -3} |

Now, we can just iterate from left to right and whichever element is not ve-, we can return i+1 as the answer.
**Example: {-8, -1, -4, -2, 6, -3}**
Here, index: 4 is +ve, hence 5 is the answer.

**NOTE:** Since we are marking elements as negative, so when checking presence of a certain number, we'll have to consider the absolute value of it.

#### Pseudocode
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    int ele = abs(A[i]);

    if (ele >= 1 && ele <= N) {
        int idx = ele - 1;
        A[idx] = -1 * abs(A[i]);
    }
}
```

### Find First Missing Natural Number For Negative Numbers
#### How to resolve for negative numbers ?

Will negatives ever be our answer?
**NO!**
So, we don't have to care about them!

Should we change them to ve+ ?
**NO!** They may fall in our answer range.

Should we mark them 0?
**NO!** Then we will not be able to mark the presence of a number!

***We can just change negative number to a number that is out of our answer range. **It can be N+2**.***

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (A[i] <= 0) {
        A[i] = N + 2;
    }
}

for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    int ele = abs(A[i]);

    if (ele >= 1 && ele <= N) {
        int idx = ele - 1;
        A[idx] = -1 * abs(A[i]);
    }
}

for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (A[i] > 0) return i + 1;
}
return N + 1;
```
>Please show a dry run on - {4, 0, 1, -5, -10, 8, 2, 6}

**Time Complexity:** O(N)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
