# Linked List 1: Introduction

---
## Linked List

### Issues with Array 
We need continuous space in memory to store Array elements. Now, it may happen that we have required space in chunks but not continuous, then we will not be able to create an Array.

### Linked List
* A linear data structure that can utilize all the free memory 
* We need not have continuous space to store nodes of a Linked List.

### Representation of Linked List

<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/052/211/original/upload_7e7b22bf1e51fd9e12b9c9a524701df4.png?1696392677" width=300/>

* it has a data section where the data is present
* a next pointer which points to next element of the linked list

### Structure of Linked List

```java
class Node{
    int data;
    Node next;
    Node(int x){
        data = x;
        next = null;
    }
}
```
**Example of Linked List**

* the first node of the linked list is called head
* any linked list is represented by its first node

### Question
Where will the "next" pointer of the last node point to?

**Choices**
- [ ] First Node
- [ ] Any Node
- [ ] Middle Node
- [x] Null


---
### Question
From which node can we travel the entire linked list ?

**Choices**
- [ ] Middle
- [x] First
- [ ] Last
- [ ] Any Node


---
### Operation on Linked List

### 1. Access kth element(k = 0; k is the first element)

```java
Node temp = Head // temp is a compy
for i -> 1 to k {
    temp = temp.next
}
return temp.data // never update head otherwise the first node is lost
```
> Time complexity to access the kth element is O(K). Here we can see that linked list takes more time compared to array as it would take constant time to access the kth element.

### 2. Check for value X (searching)
We can simply iterate and check if value X exists of not.
```java
temp = Head
while (temp != null){
    if(temp.data == X)
    return true
    temp = temp.next
}
return false
```
> Here if the Linked List is empty i.e if `Head = NULL`, if we try to access head.next it will give null pointer expection error.

Time Complexity for searching in Linked list is O(N).

> In linked list we cannot perform binary search because we have to travel to the middle element. We cannot jump to the middle element unlike array.

---
### Question
What is the time complexity to search any node in the linked list?

**Choices**
- [ ] O(1)
- [ ] O(log(N))
- [x] O(N)
- [ ] O(N ^2)


---
### Question
What is the time complexity to access the Kth element of the linked list? [index K is valid]


**Choices**
- [ ] O(1)
- [ ] O(log(N))
- [ ] O(N)
- [x] O(K)

### Problem 1 Insert a New Node with Data

### Insert a New Node with Data

Insert a new node with data **v** at index **p** in the linked list
>Though indexing doesn't exist is LL, but for our understanding, let's say Node 1 is at index 0, Node 2 at index 1, etc.

**Testcase 1**
v = 60 and p = 3

<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/031/738/original/p2t1.png?1681756504" width=600 />



**Solution to Testcase 1**
* Iterate to the node having index p-1 where p-1>=0 from start of linked list. Here p is 3 so we iterate till 2
* On reaching index 2 we create a new node riz with data v i.e. 60
* Set **riz.next = t.next** and set **t.next = riz**
<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/031/746/original/s2dr3.png?1681759945" width=600/>


**Testcase 2**

**Solution to Testcase 2**
**We can do the dry run similar to testcase 1 here is the final result**

### Question
Insert a new node with data **10** at index **2** in the Given linked list.

Head -> 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 9 -> Null

Choose the correct LinkedList after insertion.

**Choices**
- [ ] Head -> 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 9 -> **10** -> Null
- [x] Head -> 1 -> 6 ->  **10** -> 7 -> 9 -> Null
- [ ] Head -> 1 -> **10** -> 6 -> 7 -> 9 -> Null
- [ ] Head -> 10 -> 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 9 -> Null


---
### Insert a New Node with Data Approach

#### Approach

* Traverse till **(p - 1)th** node. Let's call it **t**.
* Create a new node **newNode**, with data **v**.
* Set **newNode.next** equals to **t.next**.
* Set **t.next** to reference of **newNode**.


#### Pseudocode 1
```cpp
Function insertAtIndex(p, v, Node head) {
  Node t = head
  for (i = 1; i < p; i++) // iterating updating t, p-1 times
  {
    t = t.next
  }

  // create a new node
  Node newNode = Node(v)

  // Inserting the Node
  newNode.next = t.next
  t.next = newNode
}
```
>Again there is an edge case to above solution can anyone figure it out ?

#### Edge Case

If p = 0 then where to insert the node ?
=> At head of the list.

#### Pseudocode 2

```cpp
Function insertAtIndex(p, v, Node head) {
  // create a new node
  Node newNode = Node(v)

  Node t = head

  if (p == 0) { // edge case
    newNode.next = head
    head = newNode
  }

  for (i = 1; i < p; i++) { // iterating updating t p-1 times
    t = t.next
  }

  // Inserting the Node
  newNode.next = t.next
  t.next = newNode
}
```


### Time Complexity for Insertion 
O(K)

### Deletion in Linked List

*Delete the first occurrence of value X in the given linked list. If element is not present, leave as is.*

**Example 1:**
```java
List: 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> -2 -> 12
X = -2

Ans:
List: 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 12
-2 has been deleted from the list.
```

**Example 2:**
```java
List: 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> -2 -> 4 -> 12
X = 4

Ans:
List: 1 -> 8 -> -2 -> 4 -> 12
The first occurrence of 4 has been deleted from the list.
```

#### Cases: 
1. **Empty list i.e., head = null**

```java
List: null
X = 4

Ans:
List: null
```
2. **head.data = X i.e., delete head**

```java
List: 4
X = 4

Ans:
List: null
```

3. **X is somewhere in between the list, find and delete node with value X**
```java
List: 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> -2 -> 4 -> 12
X = 4

Ans:
List: 1 -> 8 -> -2 -> 4 -> 12 (removed first occurrence)
```
4. **X is not in the list, simply return**
```java
List: 1 -> 8 -> -2 -> 7 -> 12
X = 4

Ans:
List: 1 -> 8 -> -2 -> 7 -> 12
```

---
### Question
Delete the first occurrence of value **X** in the given linked list. If element is not present, leave as is.

Linked List : ```5 -> 4 -> 7 -> 1 -> NULL```
X (to Delete) : 1

**Choices**
- [ ] 5 -> 4 -> 7 -> 1 -> NULL
- [x] 5 -> 4 -> 7 -> NULL
- [ ] 4 -> 7 -> 1 -> NULL
- [ ] 5 -> 7 -> NULL



**Explanation:**

The Value 1 is not present in the Linked List.  So leave as it is.

Thus, the final Linked List is 5 -> 4 -> 7 -> -1 -> NULL


---
### Deletion in Linked List Approach and Pseudocode
#### Approach

- Check if the list is empty; if so, return it as is.
- If the target value X is at the head, update the head to the next node.
- Otherwise, iterate through the list while looking for X.
- When X is found, skip the node containing it by updating the next reference of the previous node.
- Return the modified head (which may or may not have changed during the operation).

#### Pseudocode

```java
if (head == null) return head
if (head.data == X) {
  tmp = head
  free(tmp) //automatically done in java, whereas have to do manually for c++ and other languages.
  head = Head.next
  return head
}
temp = head
while (temp.next != null) {
  if (temp.next.data == X) {
    tmp = temp.next
    temp.next = temp.next.next
    free(tmp)
    return head
  }
  temp = temp.next
}
return head  
```
#### Time complexity for Deletion
**O(N)**

> It can be seen that every operation in linked list takes linear time complexity unlike arrays.

### Problem 3 Reverse the linked list


**Note:** We can't use extra space. Manipulate the pointers only.

**Example**
<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/052/214/original/upload_b1b57d6a7f3fa84de5c43c4e52abacbb.png?1696393145" width=600/>

:::warning
Please take some time to think about the solution approach on your own before reading further.....
:::

#### Approach:
- Check for Empty List:
    - If head is null, return it as is.
- Handle Single Node List:
    - If head.next is null, return head. (This line is optional and can be omitted without affecting the core functionality.)
- Reverse the Linked List:
    - Initialize cur as head, pre as null, and a temporary variable nxt.
    - While cur is not null, do the following:
        - Store the next node in nxt.
        - Reverse the next pointer of cur to point to pre.
        - Update pre to cur.
        - Move cur to the next node (nxt).
- Update head:
    - After the loop, set head to pre, making the reversed list the new head.

#### Dry Run
**Initialize the pointers**

prev = null
curr = 2 -> 5 -> 8 -> 7 -> 3 -> null
nxt = null

#### Iteration 1:
**Store the next node in nxt**
```java
nxt = curr.next; nxt = 5 -> 8 -> 7 -> 3 -> null
```
**Reverse the next pointer of the current node**
```java
curr.next = prev
```
**Update the previous and current pointers**
```java
prev = curr
curr = nxt
prev = 2 -> null
curr = 5 -> 8 -> 7 -> 3 -> null
```
#### Iteration 2:
**Store the next node in nxt**
```java
nxt = curr.next; nxt = 8 -> 7 -> 3 -> null
```
**Reverse the next pointer of the current node**
```java
curr.next = prev
```
**Update the previous and current pointers**
```java
prev = curr
curr = nxt
prev = 5 -> 2 -> null
curr = 8 -> 7 -> 3 -> null
```

#### Iteration 3:
**Store the next node in nxt**
```java
nxt = curr.next; nxt = 7 -> 3 -> null
```
**Reverse the next pointer of the current node**
```java
curr.next = prev
```
**Update the previous and current pointers**
```javascript
prev = curr
curr = nxt
prev = 8 -> 5 -> 2 -> null
curr = 7 -> 3 -> null
```

#### Iteration 4:
**Store the next node in nxt**
```java
nxt = curr.next; nxt = 3->null
```
**Reverse the next pointer of the current node**
```java
curr.next = prev
```
**Update the previous and current pointers**
```java
prev = curr
curr = nxt
prev = 7 -> 8 -> 5 -> 2 -> null
curr = 3 -> null
```
**Iteration 5**:

**Store the next node in nxt**
```java
nxt = curr.next; nxt = null
```
**Reverse the next pointer of the current node**
```java
curr.next = prev
```
**Update the previous and current pointers**
```java
prev = curr
curr = nxt
prev = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 5 -> 2 -> null
curr = null
```

The **loop terminates** because **curr is now null**

Final state of the linked list:
```java
prev = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 5 -> 2 -> null
curr = null
The head of the linked list is now prev, which is the reversed linked list:

3 7 8 5 2
```

### Problem 2 Check Palindrome

Given a Linked List, check if it is a palindrome.

**Example:**
maam, racecar, never, 121, 12321

**Choices**
- [x] YES
- [ ] NO


**Explanation:**

Yes, The Given Linked List is an Palindrome, Because it reads the same in reverse order as well.

### Check Palindrome Solution


**Solution 1 :**
Create a copy of linked list. Reverse it and Compare

**Complexity**
**Time Complexity -** O(N) 
**Space Complexity -** O(N).


**Solution 2 :**
1. Find middle element of linked list 
2. Reverse second half of linked list 
3. Compare first half and compare second half 

**Step wise solution:**

1. **Find length of linked list**
```java
n = 0
temp = Head
while(temp != null){
    n++
    temp = temp.next
}
```
2. **Go to the middle element**
// If n = 10(even), we'll reverse from 6th node.
// If n = 9(odd), then also we'll reverse from 6th node.(**5th node will be middle one that need not be compared with any node**)

So, regardless of even/odd, we can skip (n + 1) / 2 nodes.
```java
temp Head
(for i --> 1 to (n + 1) / 2){
    temp =temp.next
}
//temp middle
```
3. Now reverse the linked list from $((n+1)/2 + 1)th$ node.
4. Compare both the linked list

#### T.C & S.C

Total time complexity for checking palindrome is O(N) and space complexity is O(N).
