# DP 3: Knapsack

---
## Knapsack Problem

Given N objects with their values Vi profit/loss their weight Wi. A bag is given with capacity W that can be used to carry some objects such that the total sum of object weights W and sum of profit in the bag is maximized or sum of loss in the bag is minimized.

We will try Knapsack when these combinations are given: 
* number of objects will be N
* every object will have 2 attributes namingly value and  weight
* and capacity will be given

### Problem 1 Fractional Knapsack

Given N cakes with their happiness and weight. Find maximum total happiness that can be kept in a bag with capacity = W (cakes can be divided)

**Example**:
N = 5;        W = 40
Happiness of the 5 cakes = [3, 8, 10, 2, 5]
Weight of the 5 cakes = [10, 4, 20, 8, 15]
Goal - happiness should be maximum possible and the total sum of weights should be <= 40.

**Approach**

**`Since we can divide the objects, hence they can be picked based on their value per unit weight.`**

**`For per unit weight, below are the happiness values:`**
* Cake 1:  `happiness = 0.3`;
* Cake 2: `happiness = 2`;
* Cake 3: `happiness = 0.5`; 
* Cake 4: `happiness = 0.25`;
* Cake 5: `happiness = 0.33`;

**Solution**

**`Arrange the cakes in descending order with respect to happiness/weight and start picking the element`**
* Select the 2nd cake (happiness = 2), reducing capacity to 36(40-4).
* Choose the 3rd cake (happiness = 0.5), further reducing capacity to 16(36-20).
* Opt for the 5th cake (happiness = 0.33), leaving a capacity of 1(16-15).
* Take a part of the 1st cake (happiness = 0.3), using up the remaining capacity.
* Total happiness achieved: 23.3 (8 + 10 + 5 + 0.3).

**Time complexity** of the above solution is O(Nlog(N)) because it requires sorting with respect to `happiness/weight`.

**Space complexity** of the above solution is O(1).*

#### Pseudo Code 
```cpp
public class Solution {
    class Items {
        double cost;
        int weight, value, ind;
        Items(int weight, int value, double cost) {
            this.weight = weight;
            this.value = value;
            this.cost = cost;
        }
    }

    public int solve(int[] A, int[] B, int C) {
        Items[] iVal = new Items[A.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
            double cost = (A[i] * 1.0) / B[i];
            iVal[i] = new Items(B[i], A[i], cost);
        }
        Arrays.sort(iVal, new Comparator < Items > () {
            @Override
            public int compare(Items o1, Items o2) {
                if (o1.cost >= o2.cost) {
                    return -1;
                }
                return 1;
            }
        });
        double totalValue = 0.0;
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
            int curWt = iVal[i].weight;
            int curVal = iVal[i].value;
            if (C >= curWt) {
                C = C - curWt;
                totalValue += curVal;
            } else {
                totalValue += (C * iVal[i].cost);
                break;
            }
        }

        return (int)(totalValue * 100);

    }
}
```

### Problem 2 : 0-1 Knapsack 

## 0-1 Knapsack
In this type of knapsack question, **division of object is not allowed.**

### Question

Given N toys with their happiness and weight. Find maximum total happiness that can be kept in a bag with capacity W. Division of toys are not allowed.

---
### Question
In the Fractional Knapsack problem, what is the key difference compared to the 0/1 Knapsack?

**Choices**
- [ ] Items can only be fully included or excluded.
- [x] Items can be partially included, allowing fractions.
- [ ] The knapsack has infinite capacity.
- [ ] The knapsack has a fixed capacity.



**Explanation**

 In the Fractional Knapsack problem, items can be included in fractions, enabling optimization of the total value based on weight.


**Example**:
N = 4; W = 7
Happiness of the 4 toys = [4, 1, 5, 7]
Weight of the 4 toys = [3, 2, 4, 5]

> If we buy toys based on maximum happiness or maximum happiness/weight we may not get the best possible answer.

:::warning
Please take some time to think about the bruteforce approach on your own before reading further.....
:::

#### Brute Force Approach:
* Consider all subsets of items and select the one with highest summation of happiness.

Since there are in total 2^N^ subsequences and we have to consider each of them. Therefore the time complexity is: <img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/051/285/original/Screenshot_2023-09-29_015000.png?1695932414" width=120/>

#### Dry Run of Brute Force Apporach

<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/051/286/original/upload_1da8c9bd0252023a1565544101017689.png?1695932481" width=700/>

In the above figure each element is taken and its selection is determined based on happiness and weight.

>  Here we can notice optimal sub structure as well as overlapping sub problems.
> *Thus we can use dynamic progamming in this case*

If index and capacity can define one unique state total number of unique states are `O(N * (W + 1))` which is `O(N * W)`, as index will go from 0 to N - 1 and weight will go from 0 to W.

```cpp
dp[N][W] = max happiness (considering N objects and capacity W)
```

<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/051/288/original/upload_714587c8730fa95bdd9fb19f8674a224.png?1695932582" width=500/>

> Here taking N = i and W = j, we have two choices either to select dp[i][j] or to reject it. On selecting it will result into` h[i] + dp[i - 1][j - wt[i]]`(h[i]=happiness of i) and on rejecting it will be `dp[i - 1][j]`.

#### Base Case
* for all j when i = 0, dp[0][j] = 0
* for all i when j = 0, dp[i][0] = 0

#### Psuedocode

```java
//for all i,j dp[i][j]=0
for (i--> 1 to N) { // 1based index for input
    for (j--> 1 to W) {
        if (wt[i] <= j) {
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], h[i] + dp(i - 1)(j - wt[i]))
        } else {
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
        }
    }
}
return dp[N][w]
}
```


The dimensions should be (N + 1) * (W + 1) as the final answer would be at dp[N][W]

#### Dry run
taking the N = 4 and W = 7
Happiness of the 4 toys = [4, 1, 5, 7]
Weight of the 4 toys = [3, 2, 4, 5]

<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/051/289/original/upload_be304bd2a67fc2d8a5ce4be744955f8b.png?1695932731" width=700/>

*  Initially, we filled the `dp` matrix with zeros. Now, we will fill every position one by one.
    - At i = 1, j = 1
      wt[i] = wt[1] = 3
      since wt[i] > j, dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] => dp[1][1] = dp[0][1] = 0
* At i = 1, j = 2
   wt[i] = wt[1] = 3
    since wt[i] > j, dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] => dp[1][2] = dp[0][2] = 0
* At i = 1, j = 3
   wt[i] = wt[1] = 3
      since wt[i] <= j, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], h[i] + dp[i - 1][j - wt[i]])
      => dp[1][3] = max(dp[0][2], h[1] + dp[0][0]) = max(0, 4 + 0) = 4

Similary we wil follow the above to fill the entire table.

> Time complexity for the above code is O(N * W)

> Space Complexity for the above code is O(N * W), we can furture optimize space complexity by using 2 rows. So the space complexity is O(2W) which can be written as O(W).

### Problem 3 Unbounded Knapsack 

## Unbounded Knapsack or 0-N Knapsack
* objects cannot be divided
* same object can be selected multiple times

#### Question

Given N toys with their happiness and weight. Find more total happiness that can be kept in a bag with capacity W. Division of toys are not allowed and infinite toys are available.

#### Example

N = 3; W = 8
Happiness of the 3 toys = [2, 3, 5]
Weight of the 3 toys = [3, 4, 7]

*In this case we will select second index toy 2 times. Happiness we will be 6 and weight will be 8.*

Now here as we do not have any limitation on which toy to buy index will not matter, only capacity will matter.

#### Dry Run for Brute Force Appoarch

<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/051/292/original/upload_ad6449c2f3d6f906c8147fdd39fd37bb.png?1695961094" width=700/>

Step 1:
* if we select toy with index 1, capacity left will be `8 - wt of toy 1 = 8 - 3 = 5`. And the happiness will be `h = 2`
* Similarily if we select toy with index 2, capacity left will be `8 - wt of toy 2 = 8 - 4 = 4`. And the happiness will be `h = 3`
* if we select toy with index 3, capacity left will be `8 - wt of toy 3 = 8 - 7 = 1`. And the happiness will be `h = 5`

Step 2:
After buying toy 1
* Now if we buy toy 1, capacity will reduce to 2 and happiness will become 4
* Similary if we buy toy 2, capacity will reduce to 1 and happiness will become 5
* We cannot buy toy 3 as the capacity will be exceeded.


We will follow similar steps to find all the possiblity.

> We will pick the toy with maximum happiness that is 6 in this case after selecting toy 2 firstly and then selecting toy 2 again.

Here we can notice optimal sub structure as well as overlapping sub problems. Thus we can apply dynamic programming.

* Unqiue states here will be` W + 1 = O(W)` because the capacity can be from 0 to W

Base case for the above question:
* if capacity is 0, happiness is 0. So, `dp[0] = 0`

Equation `dp[i] = max(h[i] + dp[i - wt[j]])` for all toys j

#### Psuedocode
```java
for all i, dp[0] = 0
for (i--> 1 to W) {
    for (j--> 1 to N) {
        if (wt[j] <= i)
            dp[i] = max(h[i] + dp[i - wt[j]])
    }
}
return dp[W]
```

#### Complexity
**Time Complexity:** O(N * W)
**Space Complexity:** O(W)

### Question
We have Weight Capacity of 100
- Values = {1, 30}
- Weights = {1, 50}

What is the maximum value you can have?

**Choices**
- [ ] 0
- [x] 100
- [ ] 60
- [ ] 80

**Explanation**
There are many ways to fill knapsack.

-  2 instances of 50 unit weight item.
- 100 instances of 1 unit weight item.
- 1 instance of 50 unit weight item and 50
   instances of 1 unit weight items.

We get maximum value with option 2, i.e **100**
