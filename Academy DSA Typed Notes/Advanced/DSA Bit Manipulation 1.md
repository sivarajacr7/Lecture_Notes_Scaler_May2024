## Basic AND XOR OR Properties

### Basic AND Properties
1. **Even/Odd Number**
In binary representation, if a number is even, then its least significant bit (LSB) is 0. 
Conversely, if a number is odd, then its LSB is 1. 

    * **A & 1 = 1** (if A is odd)
        ```cpp
        181 = 10110101 //181 is odd, therefore LSB is 1

        10110101 & 1 = 1 // Performing Bitwise AND Operation

        Since, 181 is odd, Bitwise AND with 1 gave 1.
        ```
    * **A & 1 = 0** (if A is even)
        ```cpp
        180 = 10110100 //180 is even, therefore LSB is 0

        10110100 & 1 = 0 // Performing Bitwise AND Operation

        Since, 180 is even, Bitwise AND with 1 gave 0.
        ```
2. **A & 0 = 0** (for all values of A)
3. **A & A = A** (for all values of A)

### Basic OR Properties
1. **A | 0 = A** (for all values of A)
2. **A | A = A** (for all values of A)

### Basic XOR Properties
1. **A ^ 0 = A** (for all values of A)
2. **A ^ A = 0** (for all values of A)

### Commutative Property
The order of the operands does not affect the result of a bitwise operation. 

```cpp
A & B = B & A // Bitwise AND
A | B = B | A // Bitwise OR
A ^ B = B ^ A // Bitwise XOR
```

### Associative Property
* It states that the grouping of operands does not affect the result of the operation. 
* In other words, if we have three or more operands that we want to combine using a bitwise operation, we can group them in any way we want, and the final result will be the same.

```cpp
(A & B) & C = A & (B & C) // Bitwise AND
(A | B) | C = A | (B | C) // Bitwise OR
(A ^ B) ^ C = A ^ (B ^ C) // Bitwise XOR
```

### Question

Evaluate the expression: a ^ b ^ a ^ d ^ b

**Choices**

- [ ] a ^ b ^ a ^ b
- [ ] b
- [ ] b ^ d
- [x] d


We can evaluate the expression as follows:
```cpp
a ^ b ^ a ^ d ^ b = (a ^ a) ^ (b ^ b) ^ d // grouping the a's and the b's
= 0 ^ 0 ^ d // since a ^ a and b ^ b are both 0
= d // the result is d
```
Therefore, the expression a ^ b ^ a ^ d ^ b simplifies to d.

### Question

Evaluate the expression: 1 ^ 3 ^ 5 ^ 3 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 5

**Choices**

- [ ] 5
- [ ] 3
- [x] 2
- [ ] 1


We can evaluate the expression as follows:
```cpp
1 ^ 3 ^ 5 ^ 3 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 5 = ((1 ^ 1) ^ (3 ^ 3) ^ (5 ^ 5)) ^ 2 // grouping the pairs of equal values and XORing them
= (0 ^ 0 ^ 0) ^ 2 // since x ^ x is always 0
= 0 ^ 2 // since 0 ^ y is always y
= 2 // the result is 2
```
Therefore, the expression 1 ^ 3 ^ 5 ^ 3 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 5 simplifies to 2.


### Left Shift Operator (<<)
* The left shift operator (<<) shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.
* The left shift operator can be used to multiply a number by 2 raised to the power of the specified number of positions.

Example: a = 10 
Let's see a dry run on smaller bit representation(say 8)
Binary Representation of 10 in 8 bits: 00001010
```cpp
(a << 0) = 00001010 = 10
(a << 1) = 00010100 = 20  (mutiplied by 2)
(a << 2) = 00101000 = 40  (mutiplied by 2)
(a << 3) = 01010000 = 80  (mutiplied by 2)
(a << 4) = 10100000 = 160 (mutiplied by 2)
(a << 5) = 01000000 = 64  (overflow, significant bit is lost)
``` 

In general, it can be formulated as:
```cpp
a << n = a * 2^n
1 << n = 2^n
```
However, it's important to note that left shifting a number beyond the bit capacity of its data type can cause an **overflow** condition. 

In above case, if we shift the number 10 more than 4 positions to the left an overflow will occur.


```cpp
(a << 5) = 01000000 = 64 
//(incorrect ans due to overflow)
// correct was 320 but it is too large to get stored in 8 bits
```

**Note:** We can increase the number of bits, but after a certain point it will reach limit and overflow will occur.



### Right Shift Operator (>>)
* The right shift operator (>>) shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions. 
* When we right shift a binary number, the most significant bit (the leftmost bit) is filled with 0.
* Right shift operator can also be used for division by powers of 2.

Letâ€™s take the example of the number 20, which is represented in binary as 00010100. Lets suppose, it can be represented just by 8 bits.
```cpp
(a >> 0) = 00010100 = 20
(a >> 1) = 00001010 = 10 (divided by 2)
(a >> 2) = 00000101 = 5  (divided by 2)
(a >> 3) = 00000010 = 2  (divided by 2)
(a >> 4) = 00000001 = 1  (divided by 2)
(a >> 5) = 00000000 = 0  (divided by 2)
```
In general, it can be formulated as:
```cpp
a >> n = a/2^n
1 >> n = 1/2^n
```
Here, overflow condition doesn't arise.


### Question

What will we get if we do 1 << 3 ?

**Choices**

- [ ] 1
- [x] 8
- [ ] 3
- [ ] 4

### Power of Left Shift Operator

### OR( | ) Operator
**Left Shift Operator** can be used with the **OR** operator to **SET** the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit in the number.

```
N = (N | (1<<i))
```
It will SET the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit if it is UNSET else there is no change.

**Example**

<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/063/167/original/or_operator.png?1706037170" width=500/>

### XOR( ^ ) Operator
**Left Shift Operator** can be used with the **XOR** operator to **FLIP(or TOGGLE)** the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit in the number.

```
N = (N ^ (1<<i))
```
After applying the operation, if the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is SET, then it will be UNSET or vice-versa.

**Example**
<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/063/165/original/xor_operator.png?1706037082" width=500/>


### AND( & ) Operator
**Left Shift Operator** can be used with **AND** operator to check whether the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is set or not in the number.

```
X = (N & (1<<i))
```

if the value of X is 0 then the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is unset. Else the *i-th* bit is set.

**Example**
<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/063/168/original/And_operator.png?1706037268" width=500/>

### Problem 1 Check whether ith bit in **N** is SET or not

Check whether the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit in **N** is SET or not.


#### Approach

Taking **AND with 1** can help us. 
0 & 1 = 0 
1 & 1 = 1

1. We can shift 1 to the ith bit.
2. If `X = (N & (1<<i))`
    * if X > 0, then **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is set.
    * else **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is not set.

**Example**
Suppose we have 
```
N = 45
i = 2
```
The binary representation of 45 is:
```
1 0 1 1 0 1
```
The binary representation of (1<<2) is:
```
0 0 0 1 0 0
```

45 & (1<<2) is 
```
0 0 0 1 0 0
```

It is greater than 0. Hence **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is SET.

#### Pseudocode
```cpp
function checkbit(int N, int i) {
    if (N & (1 << i)) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

#### Complexity 
**Time Complexity** - O(1).
**Space Complexity** - O(1).

### Problem 2 Count the total number of SET bits in N


Given an integer **N**, count the total number of SET bits in **N**.

**Input**
```
N = 12
```
**Output**
```
2
```

:::warning
Please take some time to think about the solution approach on your own before reading further.....
:::

#### Approach 1
Iterate over all the bits of integer(which is maximum 32) and check whether that bit is set or not. If it is set then increment the answer(initially 0).
```cpp
function countbit(int N) {
    int ans = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        if (checkbit(N, i)) {
            ans = ans + 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```

Here, checkbit function is used to check whether the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is set or not.

#### Approach 2
To count the number of SET bits in a number, we can use a Right Shift operator as: 

* Initialize a count variable to zero.
* While the number is not equal to zero, do the following:
    * Increment the count variable if the **0<sup>th</sup>** bit of the number is 1.
    * Shift the number one bit to the right.
    * Repeat steps a and b until the number becomes zero.
* Return the count variable.

```cpp
function countbit(int N) {
    int ans = 0;
    while (N > 0) {
        if (N & 1) {
            ans = ans + 1;
        }
        N = (N >> 1);
    }
    return ans;
}
```

### Question

What is the time complexity to count the set bits ?

**Choices**

- [x] log N
- [ ] N 
- [ ] N^2
- [ ] 1


**Explanation** 
For both of the above approaches,
* **Time Complexity** - O(log<sub>2</sub>(N)) 
Since N is being repeatedly divided by 2 till it is > 0.
* **Space Complexity** - O(1).

### Problem 3 Unset the ith bit of the number N if it is set

**UNSET** the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit of the number **N** if it is set.

**Example**

Suppose we have a number ```N = 6```
Binary Representation of 6:
```
1 1 0 0
```
We have to unset its 2nd bit

```
1 0 0 0
```

#### Approach 

First of all, we can check if the bit is set or not by taking & with 1.

```
X = (N & (1<<i))
```
Then, we have two condition:
* if X > 0, it means the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is SET. To UNSET that bit do:
`N = (N ^ (1<<i))` {XOR with 1 toggles the bit}

* else if it is UNSET, no need to do anything.

#### Pseudocode
```cpp
Function unsetbit(int N, int i) {
    int X = (N & (1 << i));
    if (checkbit(N, i)) {
        N = (N ^ (1 << i));
    }
}
```
#### Complexity 
**Time Complexity** - O(1)
**Space Complexity** - O(1)

### Problem 4 SET bits in a range


A group of computer scientists is working on a project that involves encoding binary numbers. They need to create a binary number with a specific pattern for their project. The pattern requires A 0's followed by B 1's followed by C 0's. To simplify the process, they need a function that takes A, B, and C as inputs and returns the decimal value of the resulting binary number. Can you help them by writing a function that can solve this problem efficiently?

**Constraints:**
```
0 <= A, B, C <= 20
```

**Example:**
```
A = 4
B = 3
C = 2
```

**Output:**
```
28
```

**Explanation:**
```
The corresnponding binary number is "000011100" whose decimal value is 28.
```

#### Solution Explanation:
We can take a number 0 and set the bits from C to B+C-1 (0 based indexing from right)

Say initially we have -

| 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| --- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- | -------- |
| 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0 |

```
A = 4
B = 3
C = 2
```
It means, we will set the bits from 2( C) to 4(B+C-1) from right

This is how the number will look like finally -

| 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| -- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- | -------- |
| 0| 0     | 0     | 0     | **1**     | **1**    | **1**     | 0     | 0     |

**How to set a bit ?**
We can take OR(|) with (1<<i)

#### Pseudocode
```cpp
long solve(int A, int B, int C) {
    long ans = 0;
    for (int i = C; i < B + C; i++) {
        ans = ans | (1 << i);
    }
    return ans;
}
```

**Please NOTE:** We have taken ans as long because A+B+C can go uptil total 60 bits as per constraints which can be stored in long but not in integers.
