# Hashing 1: Introduction

## HashMap

Let's take an example:-

* Imagine we have a hotel called Reddison, which has 5 rooms.
* How can we maintain information on the status of rooms provided the hotel is old and hasn't adapted to technology yet?

Solution: The hotel may maintain a manual register for five rooms like:-

| Room no | occupied |
|:-------:|:--------:|
|    1    |   Yes    |
|    2    |    No    |
|    3    |   Yes    |
|    4    |    No    |
|    5    |    No    |


* After a few years, the hotel became a success, and the rooms increased to 1000. 
* Provided the hotel decided to adapt to technology, what is the programmatically most straightforward approach to maintain the status of rooms?
  * An array can be maintained where the index can denote the room number. 
  * If there are N rooms, we'll create an array of size + 1 where true denotes that room is occupied, and false denotes unoccupied.

* Pandemic hit, due to which footfall reduced significantly. Owner visits Numerologist who asks them to change room numbers to some random lucky numbers from [1-10<sup>9</sup>]. How can we maintain the status of the rooms now?
  * Maintain boolean array of length 10<sup>9</sup> + 1 `bool arr[10^9 + 1]`.
  * **ISSUE:** Status can be checked in O(1), but just for 1000 rooms, we require an array of size 10<sup>9</sup>.

* **Solution:** HashMaps
    * HashMap is a data structure that stores <key, value> pair.

        |  Key   |  value   |
        |:------:|:--------:|
        | 100003 | occupied |
        |   3    | occupied |
        | 10007  | occupied |


    
* **In HashMap, T.C of search is O(1) time and S.C is O(N)**   
* Key must be unique 
* Value can be anything
* **Note:** We'll discuss the internal working of Map in Advanced classes.

**In hashmap approach we can search in O(1) time and can have a space complexity of O(N)**

Let's see some questions based on Hashmap.

### Question

Which of the following HashMap will you use to store the population of every country?

**Choices**

- [ ] HashMap<String, Float>
- [ ] HashMap<String, Double>
- [ ] HashMap<String, String>
- [x] HashMap<String, Long>



* Key must be unique in Hashmap, so for that reason :
  * We use the country name as the key. 
  * Since the country name is a `string`, the key would be of type `string`.
* In this case, value is a population that can be stored in `int` or `long` datatype.
* Solution:- 
`hashmap<String,long> populationByCountry`.

---
### Question

Which of the following HashMap will you use to store the no of states of every country?

**Choices**

- [ ] HashMap<String, Float>
- [ ] HashMap<String, Double>
- [x] HashMap<String, int>
- [ ] HashMap<String, String>



* Key must be unique in Hashmap, so for that reason :
  * We use the country name as the key. 
  * Since the country name is a `string`, the key would be of type `string`.
* We know that value can be anything. In this case : 
  * Value is the number of states stored in `int` or `long` datatype.
* Solution:- 
`hashmap<String,int> numberOfStatesByCountry`

---
### Question

Which of the following HashMap will you use to store the name of all states of every country?

**Choices**

- [ ] HashMap<String, List < Float > >
- [x] HashMap<String, List < String > >
- [ ] HashMap<String, String>
- [ ] HashMap<String, Long>



* Key must be unique in Hashmap, so for that reason :
  * We use the country name as the key. 
  * Since the country name is a `string`, the key would be of type `string`.
* Value can be anything. In this case:
  * Value is the name of states.
  * To store them, we would require a list of strings, i.e., `vector<string>` in C++ or `ArrayList<Sting>` in Java, etc., to store the name of states.


* Solution:-
`hashmap<String,list<String>> nameOfStatesByCountry`



---
### Question

Which of the following HashMap will you use to store the population of each state in every country?

**Choices**

- [ ] HashMap<String, Int>
- [ ] HashMap<String, List < Int > >
- [x] HashMap<String,HM < String , Int > >
- [ ] HashMap<String, Long>



* Key must be unique in Hashmap, so for that reason :
  * We use the country name as the key.
  * Since the country name is a `string`, the key would be of type `string`.
* Value can be anything. In this case :
  * We need to store the name of states with its population. 
  * We will create another hashmap with the state name as key and population as value.
* Solution:-
`hashmap<String,hashmap<String,Long>> populationOfStatesByCountry`

We can observe that:-
* **Value can be anything.**    
* **Key can only be a primitive datatype.**   


---
## HashSet


Sometimes we only want to store keys and do not want to associate any values with them, in such a case; we use HashSet.

`Hashset<Key Type>`


* **Key must be unique** 
* **Like HashMap, we can search in O(1) time in Set**

---
### HashMap and HashSet Functionalities
### HashMap
* **INSERT(Key,Value):** new key-value pair is inserted. If the key already exists, it does no change.
* **SIZE:** returns the number of keys.
* **DELETE(Key):** delete the key-value pair for given key.
* **UPDATE(Key,Value):** previous value associated with the key is **overridden** by the new value.
* **SEARCH(Key):** searches for the specified key.

### HashSet

* **INSERT(Key):** inserts a new key. If key already exists, it does no change.
* **SIZE:** returns number of keys.
* **DELETE(Key):** deletes the given key.
* **SEARCH(Key):** searches for the specified key.

**Time Complexity** of **all the operations** in both Hashmap and Hashset is **O(1)**.

Therefore, if we insert N key-value pairs in HashMap, then time complexity would be O(N) and space complexity would be O(N).

### Hashing Library Names in Different Languages



|         |  Java   |      C++      |   Python   | Js  |     C#     |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------------:|:----------:|:---:|:----------:|
| Hashmap | Hashmap | unordered_map | dictionary | map | dictionary |
| Hashset | Hashset | unordered_set |    set     | set |  Hashset   |

### Problem 1 Frequency of given elements

**Problem Statement**
 Given N elements and Q queries, find the frequency of the elements provided in a query.
 
**Example**

N = 10

|  2  |  6  |  3  |  8  |  2  |  8  |  2  |  3  |  8  | 10  |  6  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

Q = 4

|  2  |  8  |  3  |  5  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|


#### Solution


| Element | Frequency |
|:-------:|:---------:|
|    2    |     3     |
|    8    |     3     |
|    3    |     2     |
|    5    |     0     |

#### Idea 1

* For each query, find the frequency of the element in the Array.
* TC - **O(Q*N)** and SC - **O(1)**.
>How can we improve TC?

:::warning
Please take some time to think about the solution approach on your own before reading further.....
:::

#### Approach

* First, search for the element in the Hashmap.
  * If the element does not exist, then insert the element as key and value as 1.
  * If an element already exists, then increase its value by one.
 
#### Pseudeocode
```cpp
Function frequencyQuery(Q[], A[])
{
   Hashmap<int,int> mp;
   q = Q.length
   n = A.length
   
   for(i = 0 ; i < n ; i ++ )
   {
      if(mp.Search(A[i]) == true)
      {
         mp[Array[i]] ++
      }
      else{
        mp.Insert(A[i],1)
      }
   }
   
   for(i = 0 ; i < q; i ++ )
   { 
        if(mp.Search(Q[i]) == true)
      {
         print(mp[Q[i]])
      }
      else{
        print("0")
      }
   }
}
```

#### Complexity
**Time Complexity:** O(N)
**Space Complexity:** O(N)

### Problem 2 First non repeating element

**Problem Statement**

Given N elements, find the first non-repeating element. 

**Example**

Input 1:
```
N = 6
```
|  1  |  2  |  3  |  1  |  2  |  5  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

Output1 :
```plaintext
ans = 3
```

|  1  |  2  |  3  |  1  |  2  |  5  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

Input 2:
```
N = 8
```

|  4  |  3  |  3  |  2  |  5  |  6  |  4  |  5  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

Output 2:
```plaintext
ans = 2
```
Input 3:
```
N = 7
```

|  2  |  6  |  8  |  4  |  7  |  2  |  9  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

Output 3:
```plaintext
ans = 6
```

:::warning

### Solution
**Idea 1**

* Use Hashmap to store the frequency of each element. Store <**key**:element, **value**:frequency>.
* Iterate over the Hashmap and find the element with frequency 1.

**Flaw in Idea 1**

* When we store in Hashmap, the order of elements is lost; therefore, we cannot decide if the element with frequency 1 is first non-repeating in the order described in the Array.

**Idea 2**

* Use Hashmap to store the frequency of each element. Store `<key:element, value:frequency>`.
* Instead of Hashmap, iterate over the Array from the start. If some element has a frequency equal to one, then return that element as answer.


#### Pseudeocode
```cpp
Function firstNonRepeating(A[]) {
    Hashmap < int, int > mp;
    n = A.length

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (mp.Search(A[i]) == true) {
            mp[A[i]]++
        } else {
            mp.Insert(A[i], 1)
        }
    }
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (mp[A[i]] == 1) {
            return A[i]
        }
    }
    return -1
}
```

Time Complexity : **O(N)**
Space Complexity : **O(N)**

### Problem 3 Count of Distinct Elements

**Problem Statement**

Given an array of N elements, find the count of distinct elements.

**Example**
**Input:** 

N = 5

|  3  |  5  |  6  |  5  |  4  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

**Output:**

```plaintext
ans = 4
```
**Explanation:** We have to return different elements present. If some element repeats, we will count it only once. 


**Input:** 
N = 3


|  3  |  3  |  3  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|

**Output:**
```plaintext
ans = 1
```
**Input:** 

N = 5

|  1  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  2  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|


**Output:**
```plaintext
ans = 2
```
**Solution** 

* Insert element in Hashset and return the size of HashSet.

> In Hashset, if a single key is inserted multiple times, still, its occurrence remains one.


#### Pseudeocode
```cpp
Function distinctCount(Array[]) {
    hashset < int > set;
    for (i = 0; i < Array.length; i++) {
        set.insert(Array[i])
    }
    return set.size
}
```

#### Complexity
**Time Complexity:** O(N)
**Space Complexity:** O(N)

### Problem 4 Subarray sum 0

**Problem Statement**

Given an array of N elements, check if there exists a subarray with a sum equal to 0.

Example
**Input:**

N = 10


|  2  |  2  |  1  | -3  |  4  |  3  |  1  | -2  | -3  |  2  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

**Output:**
if we add elements from index 1 to 3, we get 0; therefore, the answer is **true**.

:::warning
Please take some time to think about the solution approach on your own before reading further.....
:::

#### Solution
* Traverse for each subarray check if sum == 0.
   * Brute Force: Create all Subarrays, Time complexity: **O(n<sup>3</sup>)**.
   * We can optimize further by using **Prefix Sum** or **Carry Forward** method and can do it in Time Complexity: **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**.
   * How can we further optimize it?

#### Observations

* Since we have to find sum of a subarrays(range), we shall think towards **Prefix Sum**.

Initial Array: -


|  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  2  |  2  |  1  | -3  |  4  |  3  |  1  | -2  | -3  |  2  |

Prefix sum array: -

|  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  2  |  4  |  5  |  2  |  6  |  9  | 10  |  8  |  5  |  7  |

We need a subarray with **sum(i to j) = 0**
Using Prefix Sum Array,
**PrefixSum[j] - PrefixSum[i-1] = 0
PrefixSum[j] = PrefixSum[i-1]**

It implies, if there exist duplicate values in Prefix Sum Array, then the sum of a subarray is 0.

Example,

```cpp
PrefixSum[2] = 5
PrefixSum[8] = 5
sum of elements in intial array from index 3 to 8 = 0
```

**Summary**
* If numbers are repeating in Prefix Sum Array, then there exists a subarray with sum 0.
* Also, if the Prefix Sum Array element is 0, then there exists a subarray with sum 0.
    * Example: 
        * A[] = {2, -1, 3, 5}
        * PrefixSum[] = {2, -1, 0, 5}
        * Here, 0 in PrefixSum Array implies that there exist a subarray with sum 0 starting at index 0.
          

#### Approach

* Calculate prefix sum array.
* Traverse over elements of prefix sum array.
  * If the element is equal to 0, return true.
  * Else, insert it to HashSet.
* If the size of the prefix array is not equal to the size of the hash set, return true.
* Else return false.

#### Pseudeocode
```cpp
// 1. todo calculate prefix sum array

// 2.
Function checkSubArraySumZero(PrefixSumArray[]) {
    Hashset < int > s
    for (i = 0; i < PrefixSumArray.length; i++) {
        if (PrefixSumArray[i] == 0) {
            return true
        }
        s.insert(PrefixSumArray[i])
    }
    if (s.size != PrefixSumArray.size)
        return true
    return false
}
```
Time Complexity : **O(N)**
Space Complexity : **O(N)**
