## Agenda

- Revise Initial Rules
- Evaluating Expression
- Quizzes
- Concatenation
- Intro to variable

---
# Section 2.1 (Revision)



1. end statements with a **semicolon ( ; )**
2. JAVA is **case sensitive.** -> System, system are considered different
3. In order to print text, we use **double quotes ( " " )**
4. {}, (), " " --> All of these are in pairs.
5. Comments → 
    * **Single-line comments** start with two forward slashes ( // ). Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).
    * **Multi-line comments** start with /* and ends with \*/. Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by Java.
6. **System.out.print(); →** Just type the output
7. **System.out.println(); →** Just type the output and press Enter [cursor moves to the next line]


Now, let's check how much they remember from the last class with the help of quizzes.

## Priority in Operators:

   1. Rank 1 :  **()**
   2. Rank 2 : __*__ , __/__
   3. Rank 3 : __+__ , __-__ 

### Few important rules of doing operations 
 
* **Rule 1 :**<br> If we have same priority operators, whichever comes first from left to right that will be evaluated first.
* **Rule 2 :**<br> If we have different priority operators, whichever has highest priority that will be evaluated first.

**Explanation:**
Here, * and / have same priority. Because * comes first we will evaluate 6 * 7 will be evaluated first.
=> 6 * 7 / 6 
=> 42 / 6 
=> 7

# Section 2.3 (Introduction to Variables)

> Start with that numbers are of two types:
1. **Non-Decimal / Integers** 
2. Decimals

**Story :** Assume we have a container storing water in it. And then explain the three factors of container that are : Type, Name and Value

After that take a container to store integers and explain the same three factors.


<img src = "https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/235/original/upload_23ef2438b9c3b2043ca7f53fffb61f9d.png?1695417557" width = "750" height = "350">

In programming, containers are known as variables.

## Creating a variable:

width = "750" height = "250">

---

# Question 
What will be output for this ?
```java
Create a variable of type int and give name as num and assign 34 in it.
```

# Choices
- [ ] num = 34
- [x] int num = 34;
- [ ] int 34 num
- [ ] num int = 34



---

# Question 
What will be output for this ?
```
int val = 30;
System.out.println(val);
```

# Choices
- [ ] val
- [x] 30
- [ ] Error
- [ ] Don't Select me, I'm wrong option
---
**Explanation:**
The value of variable val is 30.

**Rule :** Whenever we use variable name, the value of that variable is used.

---

# Question 
What will be output for this ?
```
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
System.out.println(a + b);
```

# Choices
- [ ] ab
- [x] 30
- [ ] Error
- [ ] Keep focus on the above option, I am wrong




---

# Question 
What will be output for this ?
```
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
System.out.println("Sum of Number is " + a + b);
 ```
 
# Choices
- [ ] Sum of Number is 30
- [x] Sum of Number is 1020
- [ ] Error
- [ ] Above Options, Not me :)
---
**Explanation:**

Here, both operators are + and have same priority. Hence, the exppression will be evaluated from left to right.
=> "Sum of Number is " + a + b
=> "Sum of Number is " + 10 + 20
=> "Sum of Number is 10" + 20
=> "Sum of Number is 1020"


---

# Question 
What will be output for this ?
```
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
System.out.println("Product of Number is " + a * b);
```

# Choices
- [ ] Product of Number is 1020
- [x] Product of Number is 200
- [ ] Error
- [ ] Again Above Options, Not me :)
---
**Explanation:**
Here, * has highest priority. So, a * b will be evaluated first.
=> "Product of Number is " + a * b
=> "Product of Number is " + 10 * 20
=> "Product of Number is " + 200
=> "Product of Number is 200"

# Section 2.4 (Summary)
1. In Java, when we divide ( / ) integers we only get quotient.
2. We cannot divide integers by 0, we get error.
3. Priority of Operators : 
   * Rank 1 :  **()**
   * Rank 2 : __*__ , __/__
   * Rank 3 : __+__ , __-__ 
4. When two operators of different priority are there, we evaluate the one with higher priority first.
5. When two operators of same priority are there, we evaluate the one which comes first from left to right.
6. With + operator, if one of the operand is text then we concatenate both the operands.
7. Creating a variable:
    * type name = value;
    * Way 1 : 
        * int x = 30;
    * Way 2 : 
        * int y;
            y = 40;
8. When we use variable name, we use its value.
