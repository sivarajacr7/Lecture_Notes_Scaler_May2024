**Ques:** Print natural numbers from 1 to 5.

**Method 1:**
```
System.out.println(1);
System.out.println(2);
System.out.println(3);
System.out.println(4);
System.out.println(5);
```

**Method 2:**
```
int i = 1;
System.out.println(i);
i ++ ;
System.out.println(i);
i ++ ;
System.out.println(i);
i ++ ;
System.out.println(i);
i ++ ;
System.out.println(i);
```

**Comparison of Method 1 and Method 2:**
Both **Method 1** and **Method 2** output the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in order. The only difference between the two methods is the way the code is written.
* Issues In **Method 1** : Since we are updating the values as well along with copy pasting the lines.
Possibility of Human Error
* Issues In **Method 2** : We are repeating the same lines again and again.

## Loops 
Repeat a task multiple times

- For Loop
- While Loop
- Do while Loop

**Method 3:**
```
int i = 1;
while(i <= 5){
    SOPln(i);
    i = i + 1;
}
```

|  i  | i<=5  | Output |   i + 1   |
|:---:|:-----:|:------:|:---------:|
|  1  | true  |   1    |     2     |
|  2  | true  |   2    |     3     |
|  3  | true  |   3    |     4     |
|  4  | true  |   4    |     5     |
|  5  | true  |   5    |     6     |
|  6  | false |        | **Break** |

## Structure of While loop

**Step 1:** Initialization of a loop variable.
**Step 2:** Write while with condition.
**Step 3:** Write the task you want to repeat.
**Step 4:** Updation of loop variable.

## Syntax of while loop

```
initialize
while(condition){
    // task to be repeated
    // updation
}
```

> Explain dry run of the above code for more clarity

Another way to implement the above task is as follows:

```
int i = 2;
while(i <= n){
    System.out.println(i);
    i = i + 2;
}
```

Note that the number of iterations are reduced from 6 to 3.

Let us take some test cases to test our code.
Consider `n = 17`
The output should be `2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16`
> **Instruction for Instructor:** Run the code on editor to verify the same and show to the students.


In the range 1 - 17, the total number of even numbers are 8.

In the range 1 - 10, the total number of even numbers are 5.

> Based on the above observation, ask the following question to the students?
**How to calculate the total number of multiples of x between 1 and n?**
**Ans:** `n/x`

Total number of multiples of 2 from 1 to 40 is = ![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/048/485/original/Screenshot_2023-09-14_232954.png?1694714463)

# Question
What are all the multiples of 4 between 1 to 18 ?

# Choices
- [ ] 4 8 12 16 20 24
- [ ] 4 6 8 10 12 14
- [x] 4 8 12 16
- [ ] 1 4 8 12 16

**Ques:** Print multiples of 4 till n.

**Approach 1:**
In this approach, the code takes an input from the user and stores it in the variable n. Then, it uses a `while` loop to iterate from 1 to n. During each iteration, if the value of i is divisible by 4, it prints the value of i using `System.out.println()`.

```
int n = scn.nextInt();
int i = 1;
while(i <= n){
    if(i % 4 == 0){
        System.out.println(i);
    }
    i++;
}
```

If n is taken as 10, the output of the above code would be: `4 8`


**Approach 2:** **Number of instructions executed are reduced**
In this approach, the code initializes the variable $i$ to $4$ and then uses a `while` loop to print the value of $i$ in each iteration. The value of $i$ is incremented by $4$ during each iteration until it becomes greater than $n$.

**Code:**
```
int i = 4;
while(i <= n){
    System.out.println(i);
    i = i + 4;
}
```

> Contrast both the dry runs and stress on the fact that the number of iterations are reduced from 10 to 2.

It is used to find the remainder. When we take modulus by 10, we get the last digit of that number.
