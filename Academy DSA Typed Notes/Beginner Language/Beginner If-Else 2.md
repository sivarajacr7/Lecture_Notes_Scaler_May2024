# Categorize Triangles

Categorize triangle on the basis of the length of the sides

**Equilateral:** When the length of the all the sides are equal.
**Isosceles:** When the length of any two sides are equal.
**Scalene:** When the length of all sides are different.

Let `a`, `b`, `c` be the length of the three sides of a triangle. Given in each case they take some values, tell the category of the triangle. It is the given that the input values for a, b, c are positive integer values.

```plaintext
a = 20, b = 20, c = 20 
-- Output = Equilaterial
```

```plaintext
a = 7, b = 12, c = 9 
-- Output = Scalene
```

```plaintext
a = 5, b = 13, c = 5 
-- Output = Isosceles
```

```plaintext
a = 12, b = 7, c = 7 
-- Output = Isosceles
```

The equivalent code for implementing the above logic is as follows:

```java
if(a == b && b == c){
   SOPln("Equilateral"); 
}
else if(a == b || b == c || a == c){
    SOPln("Isosceles");
}
else{
    SOPln("Scalene");
}
```

# Max of three
**Ques:** Given three numbers, print the maximum among them. 

<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/045/724/original/upload_a249488f4da0204e8671e22d85267672.png?1693733958" alt= “” width ="700" height="600">



 Note that `a`, `b`, `c` can take any integer values.
 Stress on the point that `a`, `b`, `c` can also take equal values. The three test case demonstrates this point.

For example,
* a = 7,  b = 20, c = 50 ==> max = 50
* a = 10, b = 9,  c = 10 ==> max = 10
* a = 3,  b = 3,  c = 3  ==> max = 3

The equivalent code for implementing the above logic is as follows:

```java
if(a >= b && a >= c){
   SOPln("a"); 
}
else if(b >= c){
    SOPln("b");
}
else{
    SOPln("c");
}
```

# Fizz-Buzz
**Ques:** Given a number, 
* print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3.
* print "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5.
* print "Fizz-Buzz" if the number is divisble by both 3 and 5.

For example,

* n = 39, O/p = Fizz
* n = 25, O/p = Buzz
* n = 15, O/p = Fizz-Buzz
* n = 13, O/p = `No output`

**How to implement this? **

The following code shows a **wrong implementation** of the above logic:

```java
if(n % 3 == 0){
    SOPln("Fizz");
}
else if(n % 5 == 0){
    SOPln("Buzz");
}
else{
    SOPln("Fizz-Buzz");
}
```

The above code prints "Fizz-Buzz" for n = 11, but this is wrong as n is neither divisble by 3 nor 5. So there should have no output for this number.

**Another wrong implementation is as follows:**

```java
if(n % 3 == 0){
    SOPln("Fizz");
}
else if(n % 5 == 0){
    SOPln("Buzz");
}
else if(n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 == 0){
    SOPln("Fizz-Buzz");
}
```

The above code prints "Fizz" for n = 15, but this is wrong as n is divisble by 3 and 5 both. So the correct output should be "Fizz-Buzz".

So finally, the **correct implementation** of this logic is as follows:

```java
if(n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 == 0){
    SOPln("Fizz-Buzz");
}
else if(n % 3 == 0){
    SOPln("Fizz");
}
else if(n % 5 == 0){
    SOPln("Buzz");
}
```

# Nested If Else
**Syntax:**
```java

Statement 1
if(cond1){
	Statement 2
    if(cond2){
    Statement 3
    }
    else{
    Statement 4
    }
	Statement 5
}
else{
	Statement 6
    if(cond3){
    Statement 7
    }
    else{
    Statement 8
    }
	Statement 9
}
```

# Question
Predict the output of the following code?
```java
if(true) {
   if(true) {
       if(false) {
           System.out.println("Hey there");
       }
   }
   else {
       System.out.println("Hello");
   }
}
else {
   System.out.println(10 / 0);
}
```

# Choices
- [ ] Hey there
- [ ] Hello
- [x] No output
- [ ] Error



---

**Explanation:**
We are not getting an error because the inner if statement with the false condition is not executed due to the if condition being false. Therefore, the else block following it is also not executed. The program simply moves on to the next line, which is outside of any control structures and executes the statement `System.out.println("Hello");` as expected.

The else block following the outer if statement is also not executed since the condition of the outer if statement is true, and the program again moves to the next line and executes the statement `System.out.println("Hello");`

## Categorise the number
**Ques:** Given a number, classify it as follows:

* +ve and even
* +ve and odd
* -ve and even
* -ve and odd

## Example : 

**Input:** 



```java 
public static void main(){
    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = scn.nextInt();
    if(num > 0){
        if(num % 2 == 0){
            SOPln("Positive and even");
        }
        else{
            SOPln("Positive and odd");
        }
    }
    else{
        if(num % 2 == 0){
            SOPln("Negative and even");
        }
        else{
            SOPln("Negative and odd");
        }   
    }
}
```

## Scope of a Variable

It defines the point till where you can use the variable. You can only use a variable till the closing bracket of the block in which it was created.

**Example 1:**

```java=
public static void main(){
        
        
    int x;
    x = 5;

    int y;
    y = 20

}
```

Scope of variable `x`: Line 4 to 10
Scope of variable `y`: Line 7 to 10

**Example 2:**

```java=
public static void main(){
          
    int x = 10;
    if(x == 10){
        int y = 5;
        SOP(y);
    }
    int z = 9;

}
```

Scope of variable `x`: Line 3 to 10
Scope of variable `y`: Line 5 to 7
Scope of variable `z`: Line 8 to 10

**Example 3:**

```java=
public static void main(){
    int a = 10;
    {
        a = 20;
    }
    SOP(a); 

}
```

Scope of variable `a`: Line 2 to 8
Also the code will print 20 as the changes done in the variable values are not restricted to that block in which the change is done. But the life of the variable is restricted to the block in which it was created.

**Example 4:**

```java=
public static void main(){
    int x = 10;
    {
        int y = 20;
        SOP(x + " " + y);
    }
    {
        SOP(x + " " + y); // This line will give error as y is not present in its scope
    } 

}
```

**Example 5:** Redefining variable error

```java=
public static void main(){
    int a = 90;
    {
        int a = 7; // This line will give error as variable a is already defined in this scope
        SOPln(a);
    }

}
```
