### Syntax of If
**Idea:** When we want to do something when condition is True.

**Syntax:** 
```
if (condition) {
    // Statements we want to be executed
    // if above condition is True.
}
```

**Imp point:** `condition` should be a boolean expression. A boolean expression is an expression whose value can only be true or false.


---

# Question
Which of the following is NOT a boolean expression?

# Choices
- [ ] true
- [ ] 4 == 5
- [x] 4 + 5
- [ ] 4 < 5
- [ ] false

    if (age >= 18) {
        System.out.print("Eligible to vote");
    }
}
```

Check if someone has normal temperature: Normal temp = [98.0 to 98.9]

Ex: 
* 98.1 -> Normal temperature
* 99 -> Not normal temperature
* 97.9 -> Not normal temperature

Explain -> _______98.0________98.9_______
* 96.8 -> Not normal temperature
* 98.5 -> Normal temperature

**Q.** What is the Java code for this?



```
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
double temp = sc.nextDouble();
if (temp >= 98.0 && temp >= 98.9) {
    System.out.println("Normal temperature");
}
```

**Note:** Logical operators are used to combine conditions.


---

Now, we want to do something or the other accordingly when the condition is true or false.

### Syntax of If / Else
```
if (condition) {
    // Statements to run, when above condition True
}
else {
    // Statements to run, when above condition False
}
```

### Flow 1
```
if (condition) {
    Statement 1
}else{
    Statement 2
}
```
Q1: Condition True: Statement 1
Q2: Condition False: Statement 2

### Flow 2
```
Statement 1
if (condition) {
    Statement 2
}else{
    Statement 3
}
Statement 4
```
**Q.** What all statements will be executed?
**A.** Condition True: Statement 1, 2 4
Condition False: Statement 1, 3, 4

---


### Example 1
Read age of a person, check if person is at retirement age, or still have few years left to work. Retirement age is 65.

```
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int age = sc.nextInt();
if (age > 65) {
    System.out.println("Retired");
}else{
    System.out.println("Few more years of service.");
}
```

---


# Question

}
```

- [ ] If block<br>Else block
- [ ] Error



---


# Question

```
if(false){
   System.out.println("Line 1");

}
```

# Choices

- [x] Line 2
- [ ] Line 1<br>Line 2
- [ ] Error

### Modulus Operator

Modulus operator (%) -> Gives remainder

```
System.out.println(17 % 4) -> Remainder = 1
System.out.println(24 % 2) -> Remainder = 0
System.out.println(97 % 2) -> Remainder = 1
System.out.println(82 % 2) -> Remainder = 0
```

Explain even and odd numbers.
**Even numbers:** Numbers which are divisible by 2.
Eg: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12..
When we divide the number with 2, remainder = 0
**Odd numbers:** Numbers which are not divisible 2.
Eg: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11..
When we divide the number with 2, remainder = 1


---

### Example 1

Read a number and check if number is odd or even.

```
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int a = sc.nextInt();
if (a % 2 == 0) {
    System.out.println("Number is even");
}else{
    System.out.println("Number is odd");
}
```

---

### Example 2

Check if a number is divisible by 5.

```
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int a = sc.nextInt();
if (a % 5 == 0) {
    System.out.println("Number is divisible by 5");
}else{
    System.out.println("Number is not divisible by 5");
}
```

---

### Example 3

Check if a number is divisible by 2 or 3.

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int a = sc.nextInt();
if (a % 2 == 0 || a % 3 == 0) {
    System.out.println("Number is divisible by 2 or 3");
}else{
    System.out.println("Number is not divisible by 2 and 3 both");
}
```

# Choices

# Question

# Choices

Read 2 numbers and print max of 2 numbers.

**Examples:**
```plaintext
a = 5 , b = 10
Max of a and b = 10
```


```plaintext
a = 15 , b = 10
Max of a and b = 15
```


```
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int a = sc.nextInt();
int b = sc.nextInt();
if (a > b) {
    System.out.println(a);
}else{
    System.out.println(b);
}

```





# Question
Predict the output:
For input: 45 45

```
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int a = sc.nextInt();
int b = sc.nextInt();
if(a > b){
    System.out.print(a);
}
else{
    System.out.print(b);
}
```

# Choices
- [ ] Error
- [ ] 45<br>45
- [x] 45




### Categorize Number
Given an integer n0, categorize it into positive, negative or zero.

Category:
n = 10: n > 0: print "positive number"
n = -27: n < 0: print "negative number"
n = 0: n == 0: print "zero"

Give some more examples.

Idea:
```
public static void main() {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = scn.nextInt();
    if (a > 0) {
        System.out.println("positive number");
    }
    if (a < 0) {
        System.out.println("negative number");
    }
    if (a == 0) {
        System.out.println("zero");
    }
}
```

**Q.** Is the above logic correct?
**A.** Yes

Dry run the above code for some examples.

Explain the problem in the above approach.
It's the wastage of comparisions.



**Syntax:**

```
if (cond_1) {
    // Statements if cond_1 is true
}
else if (cond_2) {
    // Statements if cond_1 is false and cond_2 is true
}else{
    // Statements if cond_1 is false and cond_2 is false
}
```

**Note:** "else" is optional.

### Flow
```
Statement 1
if (cond_1) {
    Statement 2
}
else if (cond_2) {
    Statement 3
}
else{
    Statement 4
}
Statement 5
```

Explain the above flow according to below table.
| Conditions which are true | Statements executed |
|:-------------------------:|:-------------------:|
|             1             |        1 2 5        |
|             2             |        1 3 5        |
|         All false         |        1 4 5        |
|            1 2            |        1 2 4        |

**Note:** If a condition is true, it will execute and will come out of If/Else block and execute remaining statements.
**Note:** We can have multiple "else if()" blocks.

Back to Categorize number problem,


```
public static void main() {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = scn.nextInt();
    if (a > 0) {
        System.out.println("positive number");
    }
    else if (a < 0) {
        System.out.println("negative number");
    }
    else{
        System.out.println("zero");
    }
}
```

### Example

Is the below code correct or not?
```
int a = 10;
else if (a > 5) {
    System.out.println("Number is more than 5");
}
else{
    System.out.println("Number is not more than 5");
}
```
Correct Answer: Compilation error.

We cannot write any `else if()` without `if()` block.
