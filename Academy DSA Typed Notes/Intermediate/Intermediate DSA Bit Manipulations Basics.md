# Bit Manipulation Basics

## Decimal Number System
* The decimal system, also known as the base-10 system, is the number system we use in our everyday lives. 
* It is called base-10 because a single digit can take 10 values from 0 to 9. 

The position of each digit in a decimal number represents a different power of 10. 

For example,
```cpp
342  = 300 + 40 + 2 = 3*10^2 + 4*10^1 + 2*10^0
```
```cpp
2563 = 2000 + 500 + 60 + 3 = 2*10^3 + 5*10^2 + 6*10^1 + 3*10^0
```

## Binary Number System
* The binary system, also known as the base-2 system, is used in digital electronics and computing. 
* It has only two digits, which are 0 and 1. 

In the binary system, each digit represents a different power of 2. 

For example,
```cpp
110 = 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6
```
```cpp
1011 = 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11
```

---
### Binary to Decimal Conversion
For this conversion, we need to multiply each digit of the binary number by the corresponding power of 2, and then add up the results.

**Example 1:**
Convert binary number 1101 to decimal number.

```
Starting from the rightmost digit, we have:

1 * 2^0 = 1
0 * 2^1 = 0
1 * 2^2 = 4
1 * 2^3 = 8

Adding up the results, we get:

1 + 0 + 4 + 8 = 13

Therefore, the decimal equivalent of the binary number 1101 is 13.
```

**Example 2:**
Convert binary number 10101 to decimal number.

- Starting from the rightmost digit, we have:
```
1 * 2^0 = 1
0 * 2^1 = 0
1 * 2^2 = 4
0 * 2^3 = 0
1 * 2^4 = 16
```
- Adding up the results, we get:

```
1 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 16 = 21
```

Therefore, the decimal equivalent of the binary number 10101 is 21.

### Question
What is the decimal representation of this binary number: 1011010

**Choices**

- [ ] 45
- [x] 90
- [ ] 94
- [ ] 130


**Explanation:** 

Starting from the rightmost digit, we have:
0 * 2^0 = 0
1 * 2^1 = 2
0 * 2^2 = 0
1 * 2^3 = 8
1 * 2^4 = 16
0 * 2^5 = 0
1 * 2^6 = 64
Adding up the results, we get: 0 + 2 + 0 + 8 + 16 + 0 + 64 = 90
Therefore, the decimal representation of the binary number 1011010 is 90.

**Explanation:**

* Start by adding the rightmost digits: 8 + 3 = 11 (digit =  11%10 = 1, carry 11/10 = 1)
* Next column: 1 + 6 + 5 = 12 (digit =  12%10 = 2, carry 12/10 = 1)
* Final column: 1 + 3 + 4 = 8 (digit =  8%10 = 8, carry 8/10 = 0)

Therefore, answer is 821.

### Addition of Binary Numbers
**Example 1:**

|   | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| + |   | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

**Explanation:**
d = answer digit, c = carry 
* From right, 1 + 1 = 2 (d =  2%2=0, c = 2/2 = 1)
* Next: 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 (d =  1%2=1, c = 1/2 = 0)
* Next: 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 (d =  2%2=0, c = 2/2 = 1)
* Next: 1 + 0 + 1= 2 (d =  2%2=0, c = 2/2 = 1)
* Final: 1 + 1 = 2 (d =  2%2=0, c = 2/2 = 1)
* Finally, 1 carry is remaining, so write 1.

The result is 100010 in binary.



**Example 2:**

|   | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| + | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

**Explanation:**
d = answer digit, c = carry 
* From Right: 1 + 0 = 1 (d: 1%2 = 1, c: 1/2 = 0)
* Next column: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 (d: 1%2 = 1, c: 1/2 = 0)
* Next column: 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 (d: 2%2 = 0, c: 2/2 = 1)
* Next column: 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 (d: 1%2 = 1, c: 1/2 = 0)
* Next column: 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 (d: 1%2 = 1, c: 1/2 = 0)
* Next column: 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 (d: 2%2 = 0, c: 2/2 = 1)
* Finally, 1 carry is remaining, so write 1.

The result is 1011011 in binary.

### Bitwise Operators
* Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual bits of binary numbers. 
* They are often used in computer programming to manipulate binary data. 
* In bitwise operations, `0 -> false/unset` and `1 -> true/set`

#### AND (&)
* This operator takes two binary numbers and performs a logical AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits. 
* The resulting bit in the output is 1 if and only if both the corresponding bits in the input are 1. Otherwise, the resulting bit is 0. 
* The symbol for AND operator is '&'.
``` cpp
0 & 0 = 0
1 & 0 = 0
0 & 1 = 0
1 & 1 = 1
``` 
#### OR (|)
* This operator takes two binary numbers and performs a logical OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits.
* The resulting bit in the output is 1 if either one or both of the corresponding bits in the input are 1. Otherwise, the resulting bit is 0. 
* The symbol for OR operator is '|'.
``` cpp
0 | 0 = 0
1 | 0 = 1
0 | 1 = 1
1 | 1 = 1
``` 
#### XOR (^)
* This operator takes two binary numbers and performs a logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation on each pair of corresponding bits. 
* The resulting bit in the output is 1 if the corresponding bits in the input are different. Otherwise, the resulting bit is 0. 
* The symbol for XOR operator is '^'.
``` cpp
0 ^ 0 = 0
1 ^ 0 = 1
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
``` 
#### NOT(!/~)
* This operator takes a single binary number and performs a logical NOT operation on each bit. 
* The resulting bit in the output is the opposite of the corresponding bit in the input.
* The symbols for NOT operator are '~' or '!'.
``` cpp
~0 = 1
~1 = 0
```

### Bitwise Operations Example

**Example 1:**
```cpp
5 & 6
//Binary representation
5 -> 101
6 -> 110
// Bitwise AND operation
101 & 110 = 100 = 4
```

**Example 2:**
```cpp
20 & 45
//Binary representation
20 -> 010100
45 -> 101101
// Bitwise AND operation
010100 & 101101 = 111101 = 61
```
**Example 3:**
```cpp
92 & 154
//Binary representation
92 -> 01011100
154 -> 10011010
// Bitwise OR operation
01011100 | 10011010 = 11011110 = 222
```
**Example 4**:
```cpp
~01011100
//Binary representation
92 -> 01011100
// Bitwise NOT operation
~01011100 = 10100011 = 163
```
**Example 5:**
```cpp
92 ^ 154
//Binary representation
92 -> 01011100
154 -> 10011010
// Bitwise XOR operation
01011100 ^ 10011010 = 11000110 = 198
```

### Question

What is the value of A ^ B (i.e. A XOR B) where, A = 20 and B = 45?

**Choices**

- [ ] 4
- [ ] 20
- [x] 57
- [ ] 61
 
 
**Explanation:** 
* A = 20 = 00010100 (in binary)
* B = 45 = 00101101 (in binary)

Performing XOR on each pair of bits, we get: 
```
00010100 ^ 00101101 = 00111001
```

Therefore, the value of A XOR B is 00111001, which is 57 in decimal format.

### Binary Representation of Negative numbers

To convert a negative number to its binary representation, we can use two's complement representation. 

It works as follows -

* Convert the absolute value of number to Binary representation.
* Invert all the bits of number obtained in step 1.
* Add 1 to the number obtained in step 2.

Example of converting the negative number $-5$ to its $8-bit$ binary representation:
1. 5 to binary representation:```0000 0101```
2. Invert all the bits:`0000 0101 -> 1111 1010`
3. Add 1 to the inverted binary representation: 
`1111 1010 + 0000 0001 = 1111 1011`

**Note:** 
1. The MSB has a negative base and that is where the negative sign comes from.
2. In case of positive number, MSB is always 0 and in case of negative number, MSB is 1.

### Range of Data Types
What is the minimum & maximum no. that can be stored in the given no. of bits?

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1K61joE3.png)

Generalisation for N Bits:

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk1JbioE2.png)

So, in general we can say that the {minimum,maximum} number in n-bit number is **{-2<sup>N-1</sup> , 2<sup>N-1</sup>-1}**.

#### Integer(32-bit number)
Integer is the 32 bit number. Its range is **{-2<sup>32-1</sup> , 2<sup>32-1</sup>-1}**.
#### Long(64-bit number)
Long is the 64 bit number. Its range is **{-2<sup>64-1</sup> , 2<sup>64-1</sup>-1}**.

### Approximation
Approximation is done to better approximate the range of values that can be stored in integer or long.

### Importance of Constraints
Let's understand the importance of constraints using example.
Suppose we have two integers as
```
a = 10^5
b = 10^6
```
What will be the value of c ?

#### TRY 1:
```
int c = a*b
```
It will Overflow, i.e **c** will contain wrong value.

**Fails, the Reason:**
* The calculation happens at ALU.
* If we provide ALU with two INT, it calculates result in INT.
* Therefore, $a*b$ will overflow before even getting stored in c.



#### TRY 2:

Say, we change the data type of c to long, what will be the value of c?
```
long c = a*b
```
**Fails, the Reason:**
**c** would contain overflowed value since $a*b$ will overflow at the time of calculation, therefore there's no use to change datatype of **c** from INT to LONG.



#### TRY 3:
What if we typecast $a*b$ to long as below?

```
long c = long (a*b)
```

**Fails, the Reason:**
Already overflown, hence no use to typecast later.



#### TRY 4:
What if we change the equation as shown below?
```
long c = (long) a * b
```
This is the correct way to store.

**WORKS, the Reason:**
* Here, we have typecasted **a** to long before multiplying with **b**.
* If we send one INT and one LONG, ALU calculates answer in LONG.



### Question

Given an array of size N, calculate the sum of array elements.
**Constraints:**
1 <= N <= 10<sup>5</sup>
1 <= A[i] <= 10<sup>6</sup>

Is the following code correct ?

```
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    sum = sum + A[i];
}
print(sum)
```

**We should look at constraints.**
As per constraint, range of sum will be as follows -
**1 <= sum <= 10<sup>11</sup>**

The above code is incorrect since sum can be as big as 10<sup>11</sup> which can't be stored in INTEGER.
Hence, we should change dataType of "sum" to LONG.
