# 2D Matrices

### Definition
A 2D matrix is a specific type of 2D array that has a rectangular grid of numbers, where each number is called an element. It is a mathematical structure that consists of a set of numbers arranged in rows and columns.
2D matrix can be declared as:

```
int mat[N][M];
```
*int* is the datatype.
*mat* is the matrix name.
*N* is the number of rows in matrix.
*M* is the number of columns in matrix.

*mat[i][j]* represents the element present in the *i-th* row of *j-th* column.

Below is the pictorial representation of 2D matrix.

**Note:** A matrix having *N* rows and *M* columns can store **N*M** elements. 



### Question

Given a matrix of size NxM. What will be the index of the top right cell?
Choose the correct answer

**Choices**
- [ ] 0,0
- [ ] 0,M
- [ ] M-1,0
- [x] 0,M-1


### Question

Given a matrix of size NxM. What will be the index of the bottom right cell?
Choose the correct answer

**Choices**
- [ ] N,M
- [ ] M,N
- [x] N-1,M-1
- [ ] M-1,N-1

### Question 1 : Given a matrix print row-wise sum

**Problem Statement**
Given a 2D matrix mat[N][M], print the row-wise sum.

#### TestCase

**Input:**

```
mat[3][4] = {
    {1,2,3,4},
    {5,6,7,8},
    {9,10,11,12}
}
```

**Output:**

```
10
26
42
```

### Approach

The approach is to traverse each row and while traversing take the sum of all the elements present in that row.

### Pseudocode:
```cpp
function SumRow(int mat[N][M]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            sum = sum + mat[i][j];
        }
        print(sum);
    }
}
```


### Question

What is the time and space complexity of to calculate row-wise sum for a matrix of size N*M?
Choose the correct answer

**Choices**
- [ ] TC: O(N^2), SC: O(n)
- [ ] TC: O(N^2), SC: O(1)
- [ ] TC: O(N^M), SC: O(n)
- [x] TC: O(N*M), SC: O(1)


Since we are iterating over all the elements just once, hence
Time Complexity: **O(N*M)**.

We are not using any extra space,
Space Complextiy: **O(1)**.

### Question 2 : Given a matrix print col-wise sum

Given a 2D matrix mat[N][M], print the column-wise sum.

**TestCase**

```
mat[3][4] = {
    {1,2,3,4},
    {5,6,7,8},
    {9,10,11,12}
}
```

**Output**

```
15 18 21 24
```

### Approach

While traversing each column, we can calculate sum of all the elements present in that column.

### Pseudocode
```cpp
function SumColumn(int mat[N][M]) {
    for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            sum = sum + mat[i][j];
        }
        print(sum);
    }
}
```

#### Complexity
Time Complexity: **O(N*M)**.
Space Complextiy: **O(1)**.

### Question 3 : Given a square matrix print diagonals

Given a matrix 2D square matrix mat[N][N], print diagonals.

How many main Diagonals are there in a square matrix? 
$2.$

1. **Principal Diagonal:** From top left to bottom right.
3. **Anti Diagonal:** From top right to bottom left.

![](https://i.imgur.com/aJ4chji.png)


First, let's print **Principal Diagonal**

**TestCase**

```
mat[3][3] = {
    {1,2,3},
    {5,6,7},
    {9,10,11}
}
```

**Output:**

```
1 6 11
```
### Question 3 Approach

#### Pseudocode:
```cpp
function PrintDiagonal(int mat[N][N]) {
    int i = 0;
    while (i < N) {
        print(mat[i][i]);
        i = i + 1;
    }
}
```


### Question

Given a matrix of size NxN. What will be the time complexity to print the diagonal elements?
Chose the correct answer

**Choices**
- [ ] O(N*sqrt(N))
- [x] O(N)
- [ ] O(N^2)
- [ ] O(NlogN)


Since i starts at 0 and goes till N-1, hence there are total N iterations.

Time Complexity: **O(N)**.
Space Complextiy: **O(1)**.

### Given square matrix, print **Anti-diagonal**

**TestCase**
```
mat[3][3] = {
    {1,2,3},
    {5,6,7},
    {9,10,11}
}
```

**Output:**

```
3 6 9
```

### Pseudocode:
```cpp
function PrintDiagonal(int mat[N][N]) {
    int i = 0, j = N - 1;
    while (i < N) {
        print(mat[i][j]);
        i++;
        j--;
    }
}
```

### Complexity
Time Complexity: **O(N)**.
Space Complextiy: **O(1)**.

### Question 4 Print diagonals in a matrix (right to left)

2 5
3 6 9
4 7 10
8 11
12

### Question

Given a matrix of size N*M, how many Right to Left diagonals will be there?

Choose the correct Options

**Choices**
- [ ] N*M

- [ ] N+M+1


1. M diagonals are starting from first row.
2. N diagonals start from last column.
3. There is a common diagonal at index 0, M-1.

So, total count = N+M-1  Let's take an example as shown below:

- [ ] 10

### Question 4 Approach

:::

* For every start of the diagonal, how do the indices change when we iterate over it?
Row number increments by 1 and column number decrements by 1 as shown in the diagram.
![](https://i.imgur.com/2cR3BTh.png)

### Pseudocode
```cpp
function print_diagonal_elements(A[N][M]) {
    //print all diagonals starting from 0th row
    i = 0

        s = i;
        e = j;
        while (s < N && e >= 0) {
            print(A[s][e])
            s++
            e—
        }
        print(“\n”)
    }

    //print all diagonals starting from last column
    j = M - 1
    for (i = 1; i < N; i++) {
        s = i;
        e = j;
        while (s < N && e >= 0) {
            print(A[s][e])
            s++
            e—
        }
        print(“\n”)
    }

### Question 5 : Transpose of a square matrix

**Problem Statement**
Given a square 2D matrix mat[N][N], find transpose.

**Transpose of matrix**
The transpose of a matrix is a new matrix obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of the original matrix. 


**TestCase**

```
mat[3][3] = {
    {1,2,3},
    {5,6,7},
    {9,10,11}
}
```

**Output:**

```
{
{1,5,9},
{2,6,10},
{3,7,11}
}
```

### Question 5 Approach

#### Observation
* After performing the transpose, what is same in the original matix and its transpose ?
The diagonal that starts from (0,0) is same.
![](https://i.imgur.com/9Xu3SYE.png)
* Along the diagonals, the elements have swapped their positions with corresponding elements.

#### PseudoCode
```cpp
function find_transpose(matrix[N][N]){
    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
        for(int j = i + 1; j < N; j++){
            swap(matrix[i][j],matrix[j][i]);
        }
    }
}
```
**Note:** If we start j at 0, the matrix will come back to its original position.

### Question
What is the time and space complexity to find transpose of a square matrix?
Chose the correct answer

**Choices**
- [ ] TC: O(N), SC: O(n)
- [ ] TC: O(N^2), SC: O(n)
- [x] TC: O(N^2), SC: O(1)
- [ ] O(N), SC: O(1)

**Complexity**
Time Complexity: **O(N^2)**.
Space Complextiy: **O(1)**.

### Question 6 Rotate a matrix to 90 degree clockwise

```
### Question 6 Approach

### Hint:

* Is there any relation between rotated matrix and transposed matrix ?

:::warning
Using the Hints, please take some time to think about the solution approach on your own before reading further.....

### Observation:
Yes, if we reverse all the rows, then it will become rotated matrix.
The rotated matrix looks like:

    mat = transpose(mat);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        reverse(mat[i]);
    }
    return mat;
}
```
