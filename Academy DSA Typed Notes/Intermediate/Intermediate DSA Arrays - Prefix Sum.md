# Prefix Sum


## Problem Description

Given N elements and Q queries. For each query, calculate sum of all elements from L to R [0 based index].

### Example:

A[ ] = [-3, 6, 2, 4, 5, 2, 8, -9, 3, 1]

Queries (Q) 

| L | R | Solution |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 4    | 8     | 9    |
| 3    | 7     | 10   |
| 1    | 3     | 12   |
| 0    | 4     | 14   |
| 7    | 7     | -9   |

Before moving forward, think about the brute force solution approach.....

## Brute Force Approach

For each query Q, we iterate and calculate the sum of elements from index L to R

### Pseudocode

```cpp
Function querySum(Queries[][], Array[], querySize, size) {
    for (i = 0; i < Queries.length; i++) {
        L = Queries[i][0]
        R = Queries[i][1]

        sum = 0
        for (j = L; j <= R; j++) {
            sum += Array[j]
        }
        print(sum)
    }
}
```
***Time Complexity  : O(N * Q)**
**Space Complexity : O(1)***

>Since Time complexity of this approach is O(N * Q) then in a case where there are 10^5 elements & 10^5 queries where each query is (L=0 and R=10^5-1) we would encounter **TLE** hence this approach is Inefficient

### Observation for Optimised Solution

#### Observation
* On observing cricket board score, we can say that queries can be answered in just constant time since we have cummulative scores.

* In the similar manner, if we have cummulative sum array for the above problem, we should be able to answer it in just constant time.

* We need to create cumulative sum or <B>prefix sum array</B> for above problem.

</div>

## How to create Prefix Sum Array ?

### Definition

pf[i] = sum of all elements from 0 till ith index.

<!-- </div>  -->

### Example
Step1:-
Provided the intial array:-
| 2   | 5   | -1   | 7   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

We'll create prefix sum array of size 5 i.e. size equal to intial array. 
`Initialise pf[0] = initialArray[0]`

|  2  | -  | -  |  -  |  -   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

|  2  | 7  | -  |  -  |  -   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

|  2  | 7  | 6 |  -  |  -   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

|  2  | 7  | 6 |  13  |  -   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

|  2  | 7  | 6 |  13  |  14  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


Finally we have the prefix sum array :-

|  2  | 7  | 6 |  13  |  14  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |



### Question
Calculate the prefix sum array for following array:-

| 10  | 32  | 6   | 12  | 20  |  1  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |:---:|

**Choices**
- [x] `[10,42,48,60,80,81]`
- [ ] `[10,42,49,60,79,81]`
- [ ] `[42,48,60,80,81,10]`
- [ ]  `[15,43,58,61,70,82]`

### Brute Force Code to create Prefix Sum Array and observation for Optimisation


```cpp
pf[N]
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {

    sum = 0;

    for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
        sum = sum + A[j]
    }

    pf[i] = sum;
}
```


                
## Observation for Optimising Prefix Sum array calculations

pf[0] = A[0]
pf[1] = A[0] + A[1]
pf[2] = A[0] + A[1] + A[2]
pf[3] = A[0] + A[1] + A[2] + A[3]
pf[4] = A[0] + A[1] + A[2] + A[3] + A[4]

* Can we observe that we are making redundant calculations?

* We could utilise the previous sum value.
    * pf[0] = A[0]
    * pf[1] = pf[0] + A[1]
    * pf[2] = pf[1] + A[2]
    * pf[3] = pf[2] + A[3]
    * pf[4] = pf[3] + A[4]

* **Generalised Equation is:** ```pf[i] = pf[i-1] + A[i]```

## Optimised Code:

```cpp
pf[N]
pf[0] = A[0];
for (i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] + A[i];
}
```
* Time Complexity: O(N)

### How to answer the Queries ?

:::success
Now that we have created prefix sum array...finally how can we answer the queries ? Let's think for a while...
:::

A[ ]  = [-3, 6, 2, 4,  5,  2,  8, -9,  3,  1]

pf[ ] =[-3, 3, 5, 9, 14, 16, 24, 15, 18, 19]

| L | R | Solution | |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 4    | 8     | pf[8] - pf[3]   | 18 - 9 = 9 |
| 3    | 7     | pf[7] - pf[2]   |15 - 5 = 10   |  
| 1    | 3     | pf[3] - pf[0]   |9 - (-3) = 12   | 
| 0    | 4     | pf[4]           |14   |  
| 7    | 7     | pf[7] - pf[6]   |15 - 24 = -9   |  



### Generalised Equation to find Sum:

sum[L R] = pf[R] - pf[L-1]

Note: if L==0, then sum[L R] = pf[R]


### Complete code for finding sum of queries using Prefix Sum array:

```cpp 
Function querySum(Queries[][], Array[], querySize, size) {
    //calculate pf array
    pf[N]
    pf[0] = A[0];
    for (i = 1; i < N; i++) {
        pf[i] = pf[i - 1] + A[i];
    }

    //answer queries
    for (i = 0; i < Queries.length; i++) {
        L = Queries[i][0];
        R = Queries[i][1];

        if (L == 0) {
            sum = pf[R]
        } else {
            sum = pf[R] - pf[L - 1];
        }

        print(sum);
    }
}
```
***Time Complexity  : O(N+Q)**
**Space Complexity : O(N)***



### Space Complexity can be further optimised if you modify the given array.

```cpp
Function prefixSumArrayInplace(Array[], size) {
    for (i = 1; i < size; i++) {
        Array[i] = Array[i - 1] + Array[i];
    }
}
```
***Time Complexity  : O(N)**
**Space Complexity  : O(1)***

### Problem 1 : Sum of even indexed elements

Given an array of size N and Q queries with start (s) and end (e) index. For every query, return the sum of all **even indexed elements** from **s to e**.

**Example**

```plaintext
A[ ] = { 2, 3, 1, 6, 4, 5 }
Query :
 1 3
 2 5
 0 4
 3 3
 
Ans:
 1
 5
 7
 0
```
### Explanation:
* From index 1 to 3, sum: A[2] = 1
* From index 2 to 5, sum: A[2]+A[4] = 5
* From index 0 to 4, sum: A[0]+A[2]+A[4] = 7
* From index 3 to 3, sum: 0

### Brute Force
How many of you can solve it in $O(N*Q)$ complexity?
**Idea:** For every query, Iterate over the array and generate the answer.

### Problem 1 : Observation for Optimisation


Whenever range sum query is present, we should think in direction of **Prefix Sum**.

**Hint 1:** Should we find prefix sum of entire array?
**Expected:** No, it should be only for even indexed elements.

**We can assume that elements at odd indices are 0 and then create the prefix sum array.**


Consider this example:-

```
  A[] = 2  3  1  6  4  5
PSe[] = 2  2  3  3  7  7
```

> Note: PSe</sub>[i] denotes sum of all even indexed elements from 0 to ith index.


If **i is even** we will use the following equation :-
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
 PSe</sub>[i] = PSe</sub>[i-1] + A[i] 
</div> 

If **i is odd** we will use the following equation :-
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
 PSe[i] = PSe[i-1] 
</div> 


### Question
Construct the Prefix Sum for even indexed elements for the given array
[2, 4, 3, 1, 5]

**Choices**
- [ ] 1, 6, 9, 10, 15
- [x] 2, 2, 5, 5, 10
- [ ] 0, 4, 4, 5, 5
- [ ] 0, 4, 7, 8, 8
 
 

We will assume elements at odd indices to be 0 and create a prefix sum array taking this assumption.
So ```2 2 5 5 10``` will be the answer.


### Problem 1 : Pseudocode


```cpp
void sum_of_even_indexed(int A[], int queries[][], int N) {
    // prefix sum for even indexed elements
    int PSe[N];

    if (A[0] % 2 == 0) PSe[0] = A[0];
    else PSe[0] = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            PSe[i] = PSe[i - 1] + A[i];
        } else {
            PSe[i] = PSe[i - 1];
        }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); i++) {
        s = queries[i][0]
        e = queries[i][1]
        if (s == 0) {
            print(PSe[e])
        } else {
            print(PSe[e] - PSe[s - 1])
        }

    }

}
```
### Complexity
-- TC - $O(n)$
-- SC - $O(n)$

### Problem 1 Extension : Sum of all odd indexed elements



If we have to calculate the sum of all ODD indexed elements from index **s** to **e**, then Prefix Sum array will be created as follows - 

> if i is odd
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
 PSo[i] = PSo[i-1] + array[i] 
</div> 

> and if i is even :-
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
 PSo[i] = PSo[i-1] 
</div> 

### Problem 2 : Special Index

Given an array of size N, count the number of special index in the array.
**Note:** **Special Indices** are those after removing which, sum of all **EVEN** indexed elements is equal to sum of all **ODD** indexed elements.

**Example**

```plaintext
A[ ] = { 4, 3, 2, 7, 6, -2 }
Ans = 2
```

We can see that after removing 0th and 2nd index **S<sub>e</sub>** and **S<sub>o</sub>** are equal.

|   i  |     A[i]        | S<sub>e</sub>    | S<sub>o</sub>     |
| --- |------------------| ----- | ----- | 
|  0  |   { 3, 2, 7, 6, -2 }          |    8 | 8 | 
|  1  |   { 4, 2, 7, 6, -2 }           | 9 |    8   | 
|  2  |   { 4, 3, 7, 6, -2 }            | 9 | 9 | 
|  3  |   { 4, 3, 2, 6, -2 }            | 4 | 9 | 
|  4  |   { 4, 3, 2, 7, -2 }            | 4 | 10 | 
|  5  |   { 4, 3, 2, 7, 6 }            | 12 | 10 |

**Note: Please keep a pen and paper with you for solving quizzes.**



### Question
What will be the sum of elements at **ODD indices** in the resulting array after removal of **index 2** ?
A[ ] = [ 4, 1, 3, 7, 10 ]

**Choices**
- [ ] 8
- [ ] 14
- [x] 11
- [ ] 9


After removal of element at **index 2**, elements after index 2 has changed their positions:
Sum of elements at **ODD** indices from **[0 to 1]** + Sum of elements at **EVEN** indices from **[3 to 4]** =
 1  + 10 = 11



### Question
What will be the sum of elements at **ODD indices** in the resulting array after removal of **index 3** ?
A[ ] = { 2, 3, 1, 4, 0, -1, 2, -2, 10, 8 }

**Choices**
- [ ] 8
- [x] 15
- [ ] 12
- [ ] 21


**Explanation:**

After removal of element at index 3, elements after index 3 has changed their positions:
Sum of elements at **ODD** indices from **[0 to 2]** index + Sum of elements at **EVEN** indices from **[4 to 9]** = A[1]+A[4]+A[6]+A[8] = **3+0+2+10 = 15**




### Question 
What will be the sum of elements at EVEN indices in the resulting array after removal of index 3 ?
[2, 3, 1, 4, 0, -1, 2, -2, 10, 8]

**Choices**
- [ ] 15
- [x] 8
- [ ] 10
- [ ] 12



After removal of element at index 3, elements are after index 3 has changed their positions:
Sum of elements at **EVEN** indices from **[0 to 2]** index + Sum of elements at **ODD** indices from **[4 to 9]** = A[0]+A[2]+A[5]+A[7]+A[9] = 2+1+(-1)+(-2)+8 = 8

### Problem 2 : Observation for Optimised Approach


* Suppose, we want to check if **i** is a **Special Index**.
* Indices of elements present on the left side of i will remain intact while indices of elements present on the right side of element i will get changed. 
* Elements which were placed on odd indices will shift on even indices and vice versa.

For example:
```plaintext
A[ ] = { 2, 3, 1, 4, 0, -1, 2, -2, 10, 8 }
```
Sum of **ODD** indexed elements after removing element at index 3 = 

<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/033/820/original/oddsum.png?1683629378" width=500 />

Sum of **EVEN** indexed elements after removing element at index 3 = 

<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/033/822/original/evensum.png?168362945" width=500 />


### Approach
* Create **Prefix Sum** arrays for **ODD** and **EVEN** indexed elements.
* Run a loop for $i$ from 0 to n – 1, where n is the size of the array.
* For every element check whether **So** is equal to **Se** or not using the above equations. 
* Increment the count if Se is equal to So.

**NOTE:** Handle the case of $i=0$.
### Pseudocode
```cpp
int count_special_index(int arr[], int n) {
    // prefix sum for even indexed elements
    int PSe[n];
    // prefix sum for odd indexed elements
    int PSo[n];

    //Say we have already calculated PSe and PSo

    //Code to find Special Indices

    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

        int Se, So;

        if (i == 0) {
            Se = PSo[n - 1] - PSo[i]; //sum from [i+1 n-1]
            So = PSe[n - 1] - PSe[i]; //sum from [i+1 n-1]
        } else {
            Se = PSe[i - 1] + PSo[n - 1] - PSo[i]; //sum even from [0 to i-1] and odd from [i+1 n-1]
            So = PSo[i - 1] + PSe[n - 1] - PSe[i]; //sum odd from [0 to i] and even from [i+1 n-1]           
        }

        if (Se == So) {
            count++;
        }

    }

    return count;
}
```
