# Sliding Window & Contribution Technique

## Problem 1 : Find the max sum out of all possible subarray of the array

### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, find the total sum of all possible subarrays.
**#Note:** This question has been previously asked in *Google* and *Facebook*.

### Solution
* We can use the previous approach, where we calculated all sum subarray using Carry Forward technique.
* Instead of keeping track of maximum, we can simply add the sums in a variable.

### Pseudocode
```cpp
int sumOfAllSubarraySums(int arr[], int n) {
    int total_sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int subarray_sum = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
            subarray_sum += arr[j];
            total_sum += subarray_sum;
        }
    }
    return total_sum;
}
```
### Time and Space Complexity
* TC - O(n^2)
* SC - O(1)

## Problem 2 : Contribution Technique

We can optimize the above solution further by observing a pattern in the subarray sums.
Let's take the example array ``[1, 2, 3]``. The subarrays and their sums are:

```
[1] -> 1
[1, 2] -> 3
[1, 2, 3] -> 6
[2] -> 2
[2, 3] -> 5
[3] -> 3
Total Sum = 1+3+6+2+5+3 = 20
```

Instead of generating all subarrays, we can check that a particular element appears in how many subarrays and add its contribution that many times to the answer.

* the first element 1 appears in 3 subarrays: [1], [1, 2], and [1, 2, 3]. 
* the second element 2 appears in 4 subarrays: [2], [1, 2], [2, 3], and [1, 2, 3]. 
* the third element 3 appears in 3 subarrays: [3], [2, 3], and [1, 2, 3].

Total = $(1*3) + (2*4) + (3*3) = 20$

### Question
In how many subarrays, the element at index 1 will be present?
A: [3, -2, 4, -1, 2, 6 ]

**Choices**
- [ ] 6
- [ ] 3
- [x] 10
- [ ] 8

**Explanation:** The subarrays in which the element at index 1 is present are - 
[3, -2], [3, -2, 4], [3, -2, 4, -1], [3, -2, 4, -1, 2], [3, -2, 4, -1, 2, 6], [-2], [-2, 4], [-2, 4, -1], [-2, 4, -1, 2], [-2, 4, -1, 2, 6 ]. There are total 10 such subarrays.

### Question
In how many subarrays, the element at index 2 will be present?
A: [3, -2, 4, -1, 2, 6 ]

**Choices**
- [ ] 6
- [x] 12
- [ ] 10
- [ ] 8

**Explanation:** The subarrays in which the element at index 1 is present are - 
[3, -2, 4], [3, -2, 4, -1], [3, -2, 4, -1, 2], [3, -2, 4, -1, 2, 6], [-2, 4], [-2, 4, -1], [-2, 4, -1, 2], [-2, 4, -1, 2, 6], [4], [4, -1], [4, -1, 2], [4, -1, 2, 6 ]. There are total 12 such subarrays.

### Find sum of all Subarrays sums continued
**Generalized Calculation -**
The start of such subarrays can be $0, 1, ..i$
The end of such subarrays can be $i, i+1, i+2, ...n-1$

Elements in range [0 i] = $i+1$
Elements in range [i n-1] = $n-1-i+1 = n-i$
Thus, the total number of subarrays containing arr[i] is i+1 multiplied by n-i. 

This gives us the expression `(i+1) * (n-i)`.

We can use this pattern to compute the total sum of all subarrays in O(n) time complexity. The steps are as follows:
* Initialize a variable total_sum to zero.
* Iterate over all elements of the input array arr. For each element arr[i], compute `arr[i] * (i+1) * (n-i)` and add it to total_sum.
* Return total_sum as the output of the function.

#### Pseudocode
```cpp
int sumOfAllSubarraySums(arr[]) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int total_sum = 0;

    // Iterate over all elements of the array and compute the sum of all subarrays containing that element
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        total_sum += arr[i] * (i + 1) * (n - i);
    }

    return total_sum;
}
```
#### Time and Space Complexity
* TC - O(n)
* SC - O(1)

### Total number of subarrays of length K


Number of subarrays of length K = Total number of start indices of subarrays of length K.



| length (K) | start of first window | start of last window |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1     | 0     | N-1     |
| 2     | 0     | N-2     |
| 3     | 0     | N-3     |
| 4     | 0     | N-4     |
| K     | 0     | N-K     |

All start positions for length K, will be within range **[0 N-K]**. Therefore total is N-K+1.

Hence, total number of subarrays of length K = **N-K+1**.




### Question
Given N=7, K=4, what will be the total number of subarrays of len K? 

**Choices**
- [ ] 3
- [x] 4
- [ ] 5
- [ ] 6


## Problem 3 Given an array, print start and end indices of subarrays of length K.


Given an array of size N, print start and end indices of subarrays of length K.

**Example**

If N=8, K=3
All start and end indices are


| start | end |
| ----- | ----- |
| 0     | 2     |
| 1     | 3     |
| 2     | 4     |
| 3     | 5     |
| 4     | 6     |
| 5     | 7     |

[start     end] = K
end - start + 1 = K
end = K + start - 1

#### Pseudocode
```cpp=
//Iterate over all the start indices
for (int i = 0; i <= N - K; i++) {
    int j = K + i - 1;

    print(i, j);
}
```

> Note: Now we know how to iterate over windows of length K.

## Problem 4 : Given an array, print maximum subarray sum with length K 


Given an array of N elements. Print maximum subarray sum for subarrays with length = K.

**Example**
```
N=10 K=5
```

| -3  | 4   | -2  | 5   | 3   | -2  | 8   | 2   | -1  |  4  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |:---:|

**Explanation**



| s | e | sum |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0     | 4     | 7     |
| 1     | 5     | 8     |
| 2     | 6     | 12     |
| 3     | 7     | 16     |
| 4     | 8     | 10     |
| 5     | 9     | 11     |

Maximum: **16**

### Problem 4 : Bruteforce Approach


We have to calculate the sum of all subarrays of size k and find the maximum out of them

#### Pseudeocode

```cpp
function maxSubarrayOfLengthK(A[], N, K) {
    ans = INT_MIN

    //first window
    i = 0
    j = k - 1

    while (j < N) {
        sum = 0
        for (idx = start; idx <= end; idx++) {
            sum += A[idx]
        }
        ans = max(sum, ans)

        //going to next subarray of length k
        i++
        j++
    }
    print(ans)

}
```

#### Complexity

For what value of k will the iterations be highest ?

## Problem 4 : Optimized Approach using Prefix Sum Array


We can use **Prefix Sum Array** since we have to find sum within a range.  

### Pseudeocode

```cpp
function maxSubarrayOfLengthK(A[], N, K) {
    // calculate prefix sum array
    pf[N]
    pf[0] = A[0]
    for (idx = 1; idx < N; idx++) {
        pf[idx] = pf[idx - 1] + A[idx];

    }

    ans = INT_MIN
    i = 0
    j = K - 1

    // calculate for each pair of indicies   
    while (j < N) {
        sum = pf[j] - (i == 0 ? 0 : pf[i - 1])

        ans = max(sum, ans)
        i++
        j++
    }
    print(ans)

}
```



### Question

What is Time Complexity and Space Complexity respectively?

**Choices**
- [ ] O(N^2) and O(N)
- [x] O(N) and O(N)
- [ ] O(N) and O(N^2)
- [ ] O(1) and O(N)

### Problem 4 Optimized Approach : using Sliding Window


We want to reduce the space complexity without modifying the given array, but how?

#### Observations
* We can get sum of next subarray using current subarray sum as follows:-
  * By adding a new element to current sum.
  * By subtracting the first element of current subarray.
  
Given array :-
| -3  | 4   | -2  | 5   | 3   | -2  | 8   | 2   | -1  |  4  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |:---:|
 
First subarray from 0 to 4:-
| -3  | 4   | -2  | 5   | 3   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Converting first to second subarray :-

| <span style="color:red"> ~~-3~~ </span>   | 4   | -2  | 5   | 3   | <span style="color:green"> -2 </span>   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Based upon above observation can we say:-
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
sum of all elements of next subarray = sum of elements of current subarray - first element of current subarray + new element
</div>

This approach is known as  **Sliding window approach**.

**We can clearly observe the window sliding in above run.**

#### Pseudeocode

```cpp
function maxSubarrayOfLengthK(A[], N, K) {
    ans = INT_MIN
    i = 0
    j = K - 1

    sum = 0 // here k iterations
    for (int idx = i; idx <= j; idx++) {
        sum += A[idx]
    }
    ans = max(sum, ans)

    j++
    i++

    while (j < N) {
        sum = sum + A[j] - A[i - 1]

        ans = max(sum, ans)
        // here N-k iterations
        i++
        j++
    }
    print(ans)

}

```
***Time Complexity  : O(N)**
**Space Complexity  : O(1)***



## Observations for solving problems on Subarrays.

### Observations
Following are the observations that can be useful when solving problems related to subarrays:
* Subarrays can be visualized as contiguous part of an array, where the starting and ending indices determine the subarray.

* The total number of subarrays in an array of length n is n*(n+1)/2.
* To print all possible subarrays, O(n^3) time complexity is required.
* The sum of all subarrays can be computed in O(n^2) time complexity and O(1) space complexity by using Carry Forward technique.
* The sum of all subarrays can be computed in O(n^2) time complexity and O(n) space complexity using the prefix sum technique.
* The number of subarrays containing a particular element arr[i] can be computed in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity using the formula (i+1)*(n-i). This method is called `Contribution Technique`.
