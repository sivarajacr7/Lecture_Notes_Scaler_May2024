- No. of help requests resolved.

- Cautions:
    - Help students, don't blatantly tell them the answer - could lead to your termination. We do perform plagiarism checks

- Students can ask doubt on both flock and interface. Be active on both.

- If the TA feels that he is good at a topic, and wishes to take classes / remedials on weekends, we would encourage that. Rewards will be performance based.
