# Why do we conduct an Entrance Test ?

The main objective behind conducting the entrance test is to assess the basic knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms.

To make you ready for [FAANG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook,_Apple,_Amazon,_Netflix_and_Google), the 6-month immersive online program by Scaler Academy assumes that you already have some prerequisite knowledge of basic programming.

# What to expect in the entrance test

Specifically, we assume that you already know basics including
- How to write a **Loop**
- What an **Array** is
- Simple algorithms like **Searching, Sorting, ..**
- some **basic Maths** like
    - How many permutations does the string "Google" have?
    - How many bits will be needed to represent the number **1 Million**


You can expect easy to easy/medium level questions on any of the above topics.

We never ask questions related to specific Data Structures like Stacks / Queues, Trees .. since we believe that your success is determined more by how consistentently and passionately you are willing to follow the curriculum, and less by your current knowledge of CSE concepts.

# Which coding language(s) are allowed in the entrance test?
Feel free to code in your preferred language, be it Python, C++, Java, Haskell, Ruby, Javascript or even BrainFuck ;)

Your knowledge of a particular language does not limit your potential as a Software Engineer. Therefore, we never put a constraint on the programming language.


# How to prepare for entrance test
Example problem, solution, approach, general tips for preparation

- Typically how much time is needed to prepare? 
- How many hours everyday should one keep for prep? 
- Dos and Don’t during prep. 
- How to use streaks effectively? 
- Prepare in a group? 
Etc. Imagine if your younger brother/sister is asking this question what all would you suggest? 

Your performance in the entrance test will be the major stakeholder regarding your selection. So, make sure to put your best foot forward. To prepare for the test, you can practice easy, easy-medium questions on InterviewBit platform. Have a good grip on your programming skills and make sure you don’t face any issues implementing the logic.
